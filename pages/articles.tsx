              There are many laws in India. These can be divided into
              constitutional law, civil law, criminal law, family law, patents
              law, property law, law of torts, and many other varieties of law.
              Usually married life and its problems are covered by family law.
              But certain actions conducted (or alleged to have been conducted)
              within the bounds of marriage by the husband and his parents,
              brothers, sisters, grandparents, and other relatives except
              children and the wifes natal family are deemed to have criminal
              nature. These actions are governed by some parts of the criminal
              law family of law, and by some laws which have a criminal as well
              as a civil colour. <br />
              The most commonly used of these laws and acts are some sections of
              the Indian Penal Code, including but not limited to IPC 498a, IPC
              406, IPC 34. IPC 498a refers to cruelty committed on
              daughter-in-law / wife by parents-in-law / husband. Such cruelty
              should normally be in relation to a dowry demand to attract this
              section. In rare cases this section can be invoked even in the
              absence of a dowry demand, if the cruelty committed has been of a
              a nature which would lead a psychologically normal bride/wife to
              attempt suicide due to extreme demoralisation, OR which would
              injure her seriously in the physical and/or mental sense of the
              word injury. The bare text of IPC 498a is as follows—
              <br />
              498A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to
              cruelty– Whoever, being the husband or the relative of the husband
              of a woman, subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with
              imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall
              also be liable to fine. <br />
              1. Explanation.- For the purposes of this section, cruelty means—{" "}
              <br />
              (a) any wilful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to
              drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or
              danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the
              woman; or <br />
              (b) harassment of the woman where such harassment is with a view
              to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful
              demand for any property or valuable security or is on account of
              failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand.{" "}
              <br />
              IPC 406 refers to criminal breach of trust. In case of stridhan
              misappropriation, real or fictitious, it can be invoked in dowry
              related complaints. IPC 34 refers to common criminal intention.{" "}
              <br />
              Another commonly used act is the PWDVA 2005 (Protection of Women
              from Domestic Violence Act). This act is not limited to wives
              alone. PWDVA can be used by sisters against brothers or sisters
              and mothers against sons also. This Act also allows action against
              daughters-in-law by mother-in-law also. (Such action may be taken
              especially in cases where crooked sons and their wives conspire to
              spoil the life of aged parents. It is not always easy to get such
              complaints (by mothers-in-law against daughters-in-law) accepted
              by the police, and an application may have to filed before a
              magistrate for the same.) <br />
              However, the husband and his other relatives have no such right.
              This is one reason why the Ministry for Women and Child Welfare is
              called the Ministry for Wives and Child Welfare by a section of
              men&apos;s rights activists. However, one saving grace in this Act
              is that a mother-in-law cannot be evicted from her own house
              (while males can be). These days the legal trend is to go easy on
              all family members of the main accused/respondent –that is to say,
              the husband– in all sorts of cases including those where civil
              liability is invoked. PWDVA mostly contains civil elements, with
              the exception of one or two criminal provisions. Such criminal
              provisions are also to be invoked only in the case of
              non-performance by the respondent(s) postcourt directions. Common
              reliefs sought by wives against their in-laws under PWDVA include
              right to residence, maintenance, and/or protection orders against
              violent husbands.
              <br />
              There is a popular misconception that the wife and her parents,
              brothers, sisters, bhabhi, jija etc. are immune to criminal
              liability for any and all of their actions. This is not true.
              Actions committed by the wife&apos;s natal family such as
              cheating, filing false cases, exaggerating facts, lying in front
              of police and court, giving false evidence, etc. are punishable
              under the law. A sufficiently litigatious husband, who has good
              legal counsel, can bring his wife to book for such acts. Even in
              heinous crimes like rape and murder, false allegations are
              sometimes –howsoever rarely– punished. So false allegations under
              laws which relate to lesser crimes (or alleged crimes, as is the
              case in this context) should be relatively easier to bring to
              book. The logic behind my assertion is that makers of serious
              allegations are given very strong legal protection in the twisted
              Indian legal system, even if they are false allegations. Witness
              the protection granted to rape accusers, who cannot even be named,
              even if their story is found to be totally fabricated from A to Z.
              But there are ways to achieve legal revenge even in such cases, as
              any really good lawyer will tell you. Murder cases are easier for
              defendants, quite incredibly if seen from a logical perspective
              but understandably if viewed through the prism of public
              perception especially in a country like ours. Dowry allegations
              are not so serious, and are not in the category of heinous or even
              serious crimes if there is no death involved. Hence the above
              assertion. <br />
              One commonly observed phenomenon in the litigation filed by wives
              against husbands is that a lot of it gets settled out of court
              finally, and very few cases reach the Supreme Court. Also there is
              an observation that only about 1 percent of complaints result in
              conviction. This has led to widespread allegations that the law is
              very often misused. Even the Supreme Court has said that 498a is
              often used as &quot;legal terrorism&quot;. A lot of high courts
              have made adverse observations about women filing false cases, and
              some state including notably Andhra Pradesh have even made the
              offences committed or alleged to have been committed under the IPC
              Section 498a compoundable. Momentum is building up against
              malfeasant wives. You might just be able to make your contribution
              to it.

              The cases filed at the CAW cell or the SPUWAC are not
              one-dimensional, which is to say that they do not have only one
              complaint in them. The most common ingredient of the CAW cell
              complaint is to accuse the husband and the in-laws of cruelty in
              relation to a demand or some demands for dowry. The specific
              details which validate or claim to validate theseallegations are
              varied in nature, and differ from complaint to complaint. This
              portion is covered by IPC 498a (Dowry Cruelty). <br />
              Another common feature is that the wife accuses the husband of
              misappropriating her jewellery or clothes or personal effects. All
              such items are known as Stridhan. This includes all the gifts
              given by the husband to his wife before they becomehusband and
              wife, that is to say before their wedding; gifts given by the
              husband (groom) and his family, other guests or persons, and the
              wife&apos;s parents to the wife at the time of wedding, and any
              gifts given to her after the wedding by anyone including her
              parents, the husband and his family, or anybody else. This may
              include jewellery, apartments, cars, anything. Stridhan is the
              exclusive property of the wife according to the Hindu Marriage
              Act, and this definition is by most accounts accepted by judicial
              authorities for other purposes too. This appears to be very
              unfair, and is indeed unfair unless you try to define fairness in
              your own terms as most people are wont to do.
              <br />
              Misappropriation of Stridhan by the husband&apos;s side is a crime
              punishable by the provisions of IPC Section 406 (Criminal Breach
              of Trust). There are conflicting views regarding that component of
              the Stridhan which has been gifted by the husband&apos;s side.
              Some experts say that taking back such gifts attracts only civil
              liability, while others maintain that this attracts IPC 406
              (Criminal Breach of Trust), which is a criminal provision.
              <br />
              If criminal liability is attracted by the action described above,
              then we should all be extremely worried, because it implies that
              one can be jailed as a fairly direct consequence of one&apos;s own
              generosity and/or expression of love towards ones
              wife/daughter-in-law. Such an interpretation also renders 406 more
              dangerous than 498a for the accused, because your house can never
              be raided as a consequence of dowry allegations, but it can in
              theory be raided if somebody makes cognisable allegations of
              misappropriation of movable property against you before law
              enforcement authorities. This did happen in earlier days,
              especially when the media fed &apos;anti-dowry&apos; frenzy was at
              its peak. These days though one does not hear about houses being
              raided by the police in dowry cases.
              <br />
              On the other hand, any gifts given by the wife&apos;s side to the
              husband&apos;s side are to be returned if and when the marriage
              collapses. If these gifts are deemed by the court to have been
              given &quot;in consideration of marriage&quot; (as a price for
              marriage), then this is considered as dowry, and the
              husband&apos;s side is liable under the Dowry Act for imprisonment
              and fine for demanding this or accepting this. <br />
              The way out of this problem lies at the beginning of the marriage.
              Take no gifts and give no gifts, and get this fact recorded by a
              minimum of four witnesses. After the wedding also, keep a record
              of all gifts given by you or your family to your wife, and do not
              give too many gifts until you are sure that she is a permanent
              member of your family and that she has started considering the
              joys and sorrows of your family as her own joys and sorrows.{" "}
              <br />
              However, in these days, when divorces are happening after even 20
              years of marriage, it is very difficult to make a correct
              assessment as to when the wife finally becomes a permanent and
              loving member of her in-laws&apos; family, and when she starts
              considering their joys and sorrows as her own joys and sorrows.{" "}
              <br />
              The other provision that commonly is included in complaints at the
              CAW cell or the SPUWAC is Section 34 of IPC (Common Criminal
              Intention). The husband&apos;s family is accused of having a
              common intention in commitment of crimes under Section 498a and
              Section 406 IPC. <br />
              The wife who makes allegations under all three sections of IPC has
              to prove irrefutably in all the four courts from the Trial Court
              to the Supreme Court that all her allegations are true, to get
              legal relief. The same is the case if she makes allegations under
              one or two sections only. The husband also has to prove that the
              wife is making nonsensical claims if he wishes to get legal
              relief. <br />

              Typical Wives who make 498a Complaints

              Many wives make 498a complaints. There are many types of wives who
              make the complaints in the police departmentscalled SPUWAC or CAW
              cell. Some of these types are described below.
              <br />
              The first type of wife who makes a 498a complaint is the genuine
              sufferer. This type is put in the first position by us because
              this type of wife deserves the most sympathy, and not because such
              complainants are the most numerous. Such wives come to the CAW
              cell to seek justice, and if they can prove their case in court,
              then they can secure the conviction of their husband or in-laws or
              both. To be considered a real victim by the law for the purpose of
              this section, a woman must needs have suffered cruelty which is
              directly related to a dowry demand, or cruelty of a narrowly
              defined variety. Good luck to her.
              <br />
              The second type of wife who makes a 498a complaint is the
              narcissistic wife, a selfish wife. She only cares about her own
              feelings, and has no respect for the feelings of her husband or
              in-laws, and wants to send them to jail. The complaint that this
              woman makes, the charges that this woman lays are usually false.
              There is a possibility that she believes that her charges are
              true, because sufferers of NPD (see next paragraph) often believe
              their own version of the truth ardently. The greed for money is so
              powerful that she forgets about her anger if she is offered the
              right price and in the end wants to extract money from the man who
              she had taken marriage vows with once upon a time or not very long
              ago. She can fake injuries to make her case stronger.
              <br />
              Her parents may be equally narcissistic (selfish) and they also
              want to extract money from the son-in-law to whom they had gifted
              their daughter by calling him their closest relative or by calling
              him the avtaar of lord Vishnu at the seven pheras. They do not
              mind if their son-in-law is forced to spend some time in police
              custody, or is harassed by police, courts, lawyers, and his own
              wife. This is the example of legal terrorism. It may be quite
              possible that the whole family of the bride suffers from NPD
              (Narcissistic Personality Disorder).
              <br />
              Very often such people are accused of suffering from BPD
              (Borderline Personality Disorder). But this is not true. BPD
              patients are needy (and victims), not callous (and victimisers).
              The situation is confusing because the same person may suffer from
              both NPD and BPD. There is a very high comorbidity in these
              personality disorders, which is to say that they occur very often
              in the same person. But in some people the borderline traits are
              subsidiary and narcissistic traits are dominant. While in other
              people the reverse is true.
              <br />
              Another type of patient is one in whom the BPD and NPD traits
              emerge alternately. Such a person may have attempted suicide, and
              in the same life may have driven someone to attempt suicide,
              depending upon whether they were in a relationship with an
              emotionally stronger or weaker person.
              <br />
              The type of person who is commonly called the high functioning BPD
              patient is actually an NPD patient. They like to makefalse
              accusations. It is in their nature. The dual-morbid person can be
              often recognised by the fact of having undergone more than two or
              three career changes, while the pure BPD patient is likely to have
              undergone long periods of unemployment.The NPD sufferer never
              waits for their partner to signal to them that their relationship
              is finished before starting a simultaneous relationship with
              another person. They may also &apos;love&apos; one person and
              marry another. They are highly prone to extra-marital
              relationships. It is almost axiomatic. The NPD also says often
              that he needs his or her space in a relationship, and may make
              false stalking accusations.
              <br />
              Another thing about NPD is its possible comorbidity with AsPD
              (Antisocial Personality Disorder), which is the disorder which
              criminals suffer from, which sends its patient to jail if the law
              acts quickly or efficiently. NPD and AsPD are highly comorbid
              (they affect the same person) because the main defining trait in
              both the disorders is the same, which is a blatant disregard for
              the feelings of others. So if a person or a family suffers from
              narcissism / selfishness, you can justifiably suspect that he/she
              is a criminal or that they are criminals.
              <br />
              Here the definition of a criminal is not that they have committed
              a crime which violates some section of the IPC, but that they have
              no regard for the feelings of their own relatives. If you want to
              argue that only people who violate some section of the IPC are
              criminals, then consider the fact that making false accusations is
              a violation of many sections of IPC, and that abetment to making
              false allegations is also a violation of one section of the IPC.
              <br />
              For confirmation of AsPD or/plus NPD diagnosis (selfish and/or
              criminals) ask the following questions. Give one point for each
              answer. Do they own a gun or a gun license? What is the opinion of
              their respected and long-standing neighbours about them (socially
              rejected by those who know them best)? How do they treat their
              employees (exploitative tendencies)? Do they have a history of
              extra-marital affairs (callousness)? Are they very intelligent
              people who lose their temper whenever they see you (persistent
              irritability)? Do their longstanding employees or subordinates
              confirm the answer to the previous question as &quot;yes&quot;? Do
              they suddenly have no longstanding employees? How did they treat
              their daughter&apos;s previous husband (using people)? Do they pay
              taxes on all their income and assets? Do they have assets
              disproportionate to known sources of income (signs of a feeling or
              a belief that they can get away with anything)? Have they made
              absurd or unproveable allegations in their criminal complaint,
              which may rebound upon them (carelessness and stupidity)?
              <br />
              Have they systematically conspired to trap you in the 498a net
              (criminal mind)? Do they belong to some cult or exclusive club or
              Primary Social Group which looks down upon &apos;outsiders&apos;,
              and/or is secretive or mysterious (group narcissism)? What is the
              opinion of their close relatives about them (social rejects)? Did
              they invite all their close relatives to the wedding? Do they have
              a penchant for buying houses or car license plates with specific
              or special numbers or mobile telephones with specific or special
              numbers in order to create an aura of exclusivity around
              themselves (false aura of high status)? Do they pay peanuts to
              their employees but love to spend millions of rupees on luxury
              cars or luxury goods or branded items or expensive holiday
              packages (stupidity combined with exploitative and selfish
              tendencies)? Do they display (even the mildest) road rage
              tendencies (feeling of entitlement combined with short temper)? Do
              they get into parking related quarrels? Do they have a history of
              occupying space by bullying or beating up others (excessive
              territoriality)? Do they boast about their connections or their
              status (feeling of entitlement)? Do they like to surround
              themselves with sycophants (narcissistic supply)? Did anyone say
              to you in hindi about them &quot;yehkisikesageynahihain&quot;
              &quot;they are not faithful to anyone&quot; (lack of respect for
              societal norms)?
              <br />
              There is a more than ninety percent chance that a person who
              suffers from one personality disorder suffers from two or three or
              four DSM Axis ii personality disorders, often one each from
              cluster A, cluster B, cluster C, and one not-specified.
              Personality disorders are not usually curable by medication. Some
              of them are treatable by talking to the patient about his or her
              problem. It is a cinch under Indian law to get divorce from
              personality disordered spouses because they are impossible to live
              with due to their psychiatric condition.
              <br />
              Who is the typical sufferer of Narcissistic Personality Disorder?
              It is the person who has a swollen ego. He or she thinks that he
              or she deserves special treatment. This thought occurs due to real
              or imagined special treatment experienced in life. He or she may
              have received special treatment in childhood or in teenage, and
              most commonly in youth because of physical appearance, position of
              self or of their father or mother, high rank, a lot of money, no
              experience of failure in life, or because of foolish members of
              the opposite gender who run after physical beauty, high rank or
              status, or money. He or she may never have suffered the negative
              consequences of poor academic performance or of plagiarising other
              people&apos;s ideas or of criminal behaviour. She or he may have
              escaped such negative consequences as a result of special or
              favourable treatment. It might be mentioned in passing that wives
              get special treatment at the CAW cell.
              <br />
              The thing about the NPD or AsPD sufferer is that he or she never
              goes to a psychiatrist voluntarily. The prognosis is also very
              poor for these disorders, which is to say that they are rarely
              curable without punishment, which is the best amongst methods of
              persuasion according to Lord Krishna in the Geeta.
              <br />
              If you are suffering from BPD, you may well be a NPD magnet. This
              is the same as saying that if you are needy, then you will run
              into selfish people all the time, because you will make even
              ordinary people feel special and needed all the time, giving them
              a swollen ego.
              <br />
              Another kind of wife at the CAW Cell is the one who makes a
              complaint because of oblique motives. Her reason for coming to the
              CAW cell is to get divorce from her husband who may be refusing
              it. When the husband sees the threat of a criminal case, he
              usually gives in and gives divorce. This is one simple way for
              wives to get divorce without the direct route of a divorce
              petition, which is the civil route, but via a criminal complaint.
              This is not the person for whom this law was made, but this person
              is fairly common. Legally speaking, she may deserve to be
              subjected to criminal charges.
              <br />
              Another related kind of 498a wife is the honest one who is willing
              to take the civil route to get divorce and compensation, but who
              is too poor to hire a lawyer and too ignorant to know that she can
              get free legal aid for her divorce case. Due to incorrect
              counselling by friends and relatives, and poor scrutiny at the CAW
              cell, she takes this route. Good luck to her too.
              <br />
              Another type of wife who makes such complaints is the one who has
              suffered cruelty, but not dowry related cruelty.

              Typical Husbands who get 498a Complaints against them

          <div className="px-40 pb-10">
            <p className="flex justify-center ">
              <br /> There are many types of husbands who get 498a complaints
              made against them. Some of them are criminals who deserve to go to
              jail. A lot of them are victims of false allegations. A lot of
              them are NRIs or techies. A lot of them have more money than their
              wives. A lot of them are people whose families gave a lot of gold
              to the bride during the wedding or after it. Some of them are
              husbands of possibly adulterous wives. Some of them are NPD
              patients, and many of them have wives who are NPD patients (see
              wives page for explanation of NPD). Many of them are fools
              suffering from self-defeating tendencies.
              <br />
              Husbands who get complained against come from all strata of
              society. I myself have talked to a book binder, a shop employee,
              and a call centre employee who had dowry harassment complaints
              against them. There are also many who come from prosperous
              families, too. Examples like Prince Tuli, Arjun Singh&apos;s
              grandson, Raghunath Mohanty&apos;s son, and the southern actor
              Prashanth come to mind. It is quite likely that the rich ones are
              victims of their own success in one out of two different ways.
              They may exhibit selfish or criminal tendencies because of their
              money, or they may be facing legal extortion attempts.
              <br />
              Some husbands who face such litigation are selfish jerks. I know
              this because scores of them have taken advice from me on the phone
              or on chat or on comments for over more than a few years now, and
              a significant percentage do not even say thank you at the end of
              such private conversations. Many even give missed calls, expecting
              me to call them back to find out their problem and then hopefully
              solve it. Once it happened that my correspondent started abusing
              me in his emails for unclear reasons. In the cases of such
              husbands it just happens that they run into an even more selfish
              wife who wishes to benefit from biased laws. Some people might say
              that it is befitting that such men get the royal treatment from
              their wives, the police, lawyers, and courts.
              <br />
              Many husbands do not stop desiring their wives even after they
              face fabricated allegations. Such men are at great danger of even
              more severe self-inflicted suffering than this. They need to get a
              grip on themselves and on reality. It is not love if a wife files
              a set of baseless allegations against her husband and his parents.
              Far from it. There is no possibility of conciliation after such a
              complaint if the man in question is sane. The only way out of such
              a situation is divorce.
              <br />
              Some husbands commit suicide or violent acts when they face such
              situations. This is understandable to a limited extent; I have
              used the qualifier &apos;limited extent&apos; because the fact
              that such behaviour is understandable does not make it correct or
              beneficial. Why should families have to face death or injury
              inflicted by their own child on himself? Attacking the wife and/or
              her parents or near and dear ones also does not solve anything. It
              complicates matters further and leads to addition of more charges
              and fresh cases. The original case also gets strengthened by such
              actions, due to the creation of a bias in the minds of some
              observers who may be in a position to influence the case.

              &quot;What is to Fear in a 498a case?&quot;
            </h3>
            <div className="flex w-10 item-cenmter justify-center ">
              <div className="border-8 border-transparent border-l-gray-600 ml-2 group-open:rotate-90 transition-transform origin-left  "></div>

            <p className="flex justify-center ">
              <br />
              Most of the questions that men who are accused of dowry harassment
              by their wives ask the people around them are triggered by the
              fears that they have suddenly started to have. It is natural to be
              concerned somewhat if you have police proceedings against you and
              your family. More so if you are a person who has never faced
              criminal charges in your whole life. Ninety nine percent of the
              men who face 498a charges are the type of men who have never been
              accused of any crime in their life. Their aged parents are even
              more innocent than them.
              <br />
              Further fears are created by the powerful social forces and vested
              interests which stand to benefit from fearful defendants. There is
              a whole 498a industry consisting of lawyers, feminists, corrupt
              law enforcement officers, media, and of course wives and their
              parents. These people have a vested stake in scaring men accused
              of cruelty by their wives. The second thing that you must remember
              is that the more you get scared, the more money these vested
              interests will make. The first thing to remember is that the aim
              of your &apos;wife&apos; and &apos;in-laws&apos; is not to send
              you to jail. They wish to profit from your fears and your desire
              to mitigate the harassment which you are facing, and are afraid of
              facing for a prolonged period.
              <br />
              What are the fears that men accused under section 498a/406/34
              usually have? Such men are usually afraid that they will have to
              go to jail, or that they will have to spend a few days in police
              custody, or that their homes will get raided by the police. They
              fear that their elderly parents will suffer health problems due to
              the stress inflicted by the running around, worrying, and the fear
              of an uncertain future. They fear beatings or torture at the hands
              of the police during interrogation. They fear that people will
              start looking down upon them. Bad publicity in the media is
              another worrisome thing. And they fear mental torture by a public
              which is sympathetic to women&apos;s causes (read wives&apos;
              causes). They are also afraid that the judiciary is biased in
              favour of wives, and that they may fail to get anticipatory bail,
              or may have to spend years in jail.
              <br />
              They also start to realise pretty soon that learning the ropes of
              the legal rigmarole is an expensive process littered with
              unexpected expenses, and spoiling of relations with the people who
              they expect to help them. They also fear, and wish to avoid
              harassment by their lawyer, and fear that the lawyer will not have
              their best interests at heart, or that he may be secretly
              supporting the other side. It is impossible to make a general
              statement regarding the validity of such fears. It is also
              difficult to say whether such fears are justified in particular
              cases without looking at them in detail, and sometimes even after
              doing so.
              <br />
              What men trapped in dowry cases do as a result of their fears Many
              men lose their jobs in such a situation due to an inability to
              concentrate on work. Almost all of them lose their mental health.
              They start smoking or drinking or other forms of substance abuse.
              They stand the risk of falling ill due to neuropsychiatric or
              psychosomatic reasons (physical harm caused to the body due to
              poor mental health). They also make compromises and pay large
              amounts of money in order to get their cruel wives off their
              backs, and to bring the nightmare to an early end. They also end
              up losing money to exploitative lawyers due to stress-induced
              impairment of judgement. They worry about their parents, and their
              parents worry about them, and all of them lose their peace of mind
              as a result. In extremely bad cases the husband&apos;s family
              witnesses a suicide or more than one suicide amongst its members.
              <br />
              <br />
              Are these fears justified?
              <br />
              No. They are not justified. The fact that you are afraid is (in
              itself) the worst punishment which you will have to undergo. And
              it is in your hands to a large extent to start fearing less,
              acting a little more, and relaxing a lot more. The lawmakers and
              the media may be blind to your needs or to the demands of justice,
              but the public, the people at the police station, the judiciary,
              your neighbours, and the growing men&apos;s rights movement are in
              your favour. Just as you will lose old &apos;friends&apos; in this
              situation, you will gain new friends too, and you will grow as a
              result of both processes.
              <br />
              You will not be beaten by the police, and they will give you a
              chair to sit every time you visit them. Your house will not be
              raided unless you are one of the rarest of rare cases, but
              remember not to accept any jewellery from your next wife (in case
              you do decide to marry again) and to sell off all your
              mother&apos;s jewellery before you get married again. Jewellery
              can bring nothing but trouble to an Indian husband.
              <br />
              You will get anticipatory bail if you are one of the overwhelming
              majority of 498a accused. Your lawyer is your friend. Do not
              mistrust him/her unless you chose him carelessly without
              conducting due diligence. Jail is not going to happen very soon,
              if it happens at all. It will take 15 years for your case to get
              settled if you fight till the final appeal, AND the other party
              has the stamina and desire to keep fighting for this length of
              time. Make sure that you select your lawyer carefully. Do not
              select your lawyer in a hurry just because you have an irrational
              fear of being arrested without warning.

              That person called a woman and your wife (while being neither as a
              matter of fact) is not a mind-reader and is unlikely to go all the
              way or to not settle for anything less than what she is asking
              today.

              Dowry and domestic violence related laws have already become a
              laughing stock amongst the police and the judiciary in this
              country, due to their rampant misuse. Rape and sexual violence
              related laws appear to be headed that way too. The making of such
              laws is grave disservice to –and a crime against– members of both
              genders.

              The criminal prosecution procedure in India follows the CrPC or
              Criminal Procedure Code of India. This procedural code specifies
              exactly the powers and duties of courts, lawyers, police, accused,
              and complainants. Amongst other things, it details out how
              somebody may be arrested, when he or she may be arrested, under
              what circumstances arrests are to be made, what procedure is to be
              followed at the time of arrest, and which officers have the power
              to authorise arrest. It also details out where the arrested person
              is sent after being arrested, whether to police custody (lockup in
              a police station), or judicial custody (jail). In cases u/s
              498a/406/34 the accused may rightfully fear arrest.
              <br />
              Bail is another subject which is dealt with by the CrPC. Bail is a
              way in which an accused person may get temporary freedom until his
              case is finally disposed of. Depending upon the seriousness of the
              allegations, a person may be able to avoid arrest altogether, may
              be able to spend time only in police custody or only in judicial
              custody, or may not be able to get bail at all, until the disposal
              of his case. The CrPC lays out how a person may be granted bail,
              and the various types of bail.
              <br />
              Anticipatory Bail can be said to be superior to interim bail
              because the former is permanent unlike the latter. It is also
              superior to bail after arrest because unlike post-arrest bail, the
              accused does not have to spend even a single day in custody –until
              his case gets decided– if he gets an AB order in his favour.
              Indeed it may be argued that AB is the best legal relief for
              accused persons out of all types of bail. This applies to all
              criminal cases including dowry cases.
              <br />
              This bail is applied for in anticipation of arrest. If you have
              reason to believe that you may be arrested for a crime which you
              did not commit, then you have the right to apply for this type of
              bail. Such belief may come to your mind if you learn about a
              criminal complaint made to the police by your wife, or by any
              threats made by her family against you and your family (this
              second one should not always be taken seriously, but the first one
              should be).
              <br />
              As soon as you learn about the police complaint against you under
              section 498a/406/34, contact a good lawyer to apply for pre-arrest
              notice or notice bail, and anticipatory bail. These are two
              separate things but they are the same thing. Let me explain. Your
              lawyer will draft an anticipatory bail application mentioning your
              version of the facts of the case, and will apply at the
              appropriate district court. The matter will come up for hearing,
              and you should try to send somebody to be there with your lawyer
              when it comes up. The court will have sent a notice to the CAW
              cell or Mahila Thana or Women Cell, and their officer will appear
              on this date, along with a lawyer who represents the government,
              usually called a public prosecutor or a government pleader.
              <br />
              The public prosecutor will talk to the police officer, and he will
              tell the judge that since no FIR has been registered as yet,
              therefore there is no grounds for granting bail. The judge will
              seemingly agree with the PP, and will ask your lawyer what he has
              to say about this. Your lawyer will verbally withdraw the
              anticipatory bail application and will make an oral prayer for
              seven days&apos; pre-arrest notice in case the police formulate an
              intention to arrest you or your family at some later date. The
              judge will grant this plea, and will pass an order telling the
              police to give you written notice seven days before they intend to
              arrest you, or your parents, or you and your parents separately.
              This is called notice bail commonly —however note that there is no
              definition of notice bail in the CrPC, nor any section of the CrPC
              which deals specifically with this type of relief.
              <br />
              If this bail application is rejected, then you can apply in the
              high court. If the High Court also rejects, then you can apply in
              the Supreme Court. Usually High Court grants this relief. You may
              have read somewhere that &quot;bail is the rule, jail is the
              exception&quot;. What this means is that courts (read judges) have
              a bent of mind towards giving bail to all such accused who are not
              likely to be able to influence witnesses if set free during the
              pendency of their respective cases. The criminal prosecution
              procedure in India follows the CrPC or Criminal Procedure Code of

              <br />
              Have you ever read in your readings about 498a on internet forums
              that getting anticipatory bail is like winning half the battle? As
              a matter of fact it is more like winning the whole battle, as I
              will explain forthwith. Before explaining, however, it is
              necessary to remind the reader that every bail order is a final
              order, and usually the only way to challenge an order granting
              bail is to apply for cancellation of granted bail.
              <br />
              Anticipatory bail enables an accused in a criminal case to remain
              free while fighting his case. Bail is usually given in most cases
              except the ones which are very serious. Even in murder cases bail
              can be given as can be seen in the Aarushi Talwar murder case.
              While bail usually comes after the stigma and the trauma of being
              arrested, anticipatory bail helps the accused person to avoid
              police custody and jail altogether. Anticipatory bail is fairly
              common in 498a cases, provided you satisfy certain criteria and
              can be said to be the norm in these.
              <br />
              The usual additional charges which are pressed by the police in
              498a cases are IPC 406, (criminal misappropriation of stridhan or
              criminal breach of trust), and IPC 34 (common criminal intention).
              The maximum length of time in jail by which 498a is punishable is
              3 years. For IPC 406 also this period is 3 years, and for IPC 34
              it is 1 year.
              <br />
              You are one hundred percent guaranteed to get your anticipatory
              bail deemed as regular bail at the point in the proceedings
              against you where you get chargesheeted (i.e. it is automatic full
              bail).
              <br />
              First of all, the chances of conviction in 498a cases are very low
              as you probably know. This does not mean that you will definitely
              escape punishment (even if you are actually guilty), but that the
              statistics are in your favour, and that you can consider yourself
              at risk of conviction only if your case is very serious. So in all
              likelihood you will not be convicted by the lowest court.
              <br />
              If the lowest court does not convict you, then the police may
              decide not to appeal in a higher court. Remember that it is
              usually the police and the prosecution which decides whether or
              not to appeal an acquittal in a higher court. The opinion of the
              complainant matters very little in this decision. Only in high
              profile cases like the Sajjan Kumar case have the complainants
              managed to appeal an acquittal without the concurrence of the
              prosecuting agency, which may be Delhi Police, or CBI, or some
              state police. The prosecuting agency is deemed to act on behalf of
              the state, and the state is operatively the offended party in
              criminal cases.
              <br />
              In case the state decides not to appeal your acquittal, you are a
              free man, and your anticipatory bail has enabled you to remain
              free all the while right up till the dismissal of the case against
              you.
              <br />
              In case the state decides to appeal your acquittal, your bail gets
              automatically extended by the court of appeal in the first hearing
              itself, and the whole process starts again. Chances of a higher
              court overturning a lower court verdict are not too high, and you
              can be fairly certain of being acquitted again. Also note that you
              can continue to live life as normal while you are defending
              yourself in court.
              <br />
              If and when you get acquitted again, the prosecuting agency will
              not have the will to appeal again. This stage is quite likely the
              end of your troubles.
              <br />
              In case the lower court convicts you, you will be sentenced to
              time in prison. Let us assume for the sake of argument that you
              get the maximum possible sentence under all three sections. This
              sounds like three plus three plus one which is equal to seven
              years in prison. But this is not the case. In India prison
              sentences are almost invariably given as concurrent sentences,
              which is to say that all the three sentences start simultaneously
              from your first day in jail. So you will be effectively sentenced
              to three years in jail in case you get the maximum time.
              <br />
              But hold on, let us not talk about jail yet. You have the right to
              appeal your conviction in a higher court. In Indian criminal law,
              anybody who gets sentenced to up to three years in jail is
              entitled to a continuation of his bail pending the disposal of his
              appeal. So your bail will get extended again. One possibility is
              that the prosecution may decide to petition the court for
              cancellation of your bail in order to force you to live in jail
              while your appeal is being decided. Courts rarely entertain such
              petitions by prosecutors in a positive way. The complainant will
              quite likely lose her morale after the lame victory provided to
              her by the lower court conviction and will start seeking a
              compromise. If not at this stage then at the next stage she is
              likely to give up.
              <br />
              You may think that fast track courts which are being proposed will
              enable women to prosecute men faster. This is not true. 498a cases
              are notorious in the judiciary for being composed mostly of false
              allegations. Everyone from the CAW Cell to the Law ministry to the
              Chief Justice of India is aware of this problem. So they are
              unlikely to create fast track courts for these disgruntled wives.
              This is especially true in the context of the much more serious
              suffering which is undergone by people who get killed, raped, or
              maimed during crimes, and they are the ones who will get the first
              benefit of fast track courts. Also remember that when God takes
              away with one hand, he gives something with the other. If
              proceedings are made quicker then the suffering of 498a accused
              will be shortened, and their chances of coming out of this ordeal
              will improve considerably.
              <br />
              Remember, in 498a cases there is negotiation and compromise
              possible at any stage in the proceedings right from the initial
              CAW Cell stage to the Supreme Court SLP stage. Foolish
              complainants compromise after wasting a few years. Wise ones
              compromise immediately, take their money, and run. So your
              anticipatory bail will ensure that you get to spend zero time in
              prison or in police custody.

              <br />
              When you apply for anticipatory bail after receiving notice of
              arrest, as described in the detailed article about anticipatory
              bail procedure in 498a cases, you will have to let your lawyer
              draft the bail application in a manner similar to the application
              which was drafted for notice bail.
              <br />
              An acceptable definition of anticipatory bail is &quot;bail
              obtained before being formally arrested&quot;. Such bail is
              granted under section 438 [1] of the CrPC of India.
              <br />
              Note that all pre-arrest bail is &quot;bail obtained before being
              formally arrested&quot;, but not all pre-arrest bail is
              anticipatory bail. Section 437(1) of CrPC can be used by courts
              which constitute the lowest rung of the judiciary to grant
              pre-arrest bail under certain circumstances (see long quote below
              this paragraph), but an AB application does not precede such
              pre-arrest bail.
              <br />
              It can be granted only if the judge is satisfied that all the
              conditions which are necessary for such relief have been met by
              you. This is not a very steep requirement for a law abiding
              citizen, and if you have a good lawyer and you are good at
              managing your lawyer then you do not need to worry at all.
              <br />
              Section 437(1) of CrPC: When bail may be taken in the case of
              non-bailable offences: [2]
              <br />
              (1) When any person accused of, or suspected of, the commission of
              any non- bailable offence is arrested or detained without warrant
              by an officer in charge of a police station or appears or is
              brought before a Court other than the High Court or Court of
              Session, he may be released on bail, but-
              <br />
              (i) such person shall not be so released... ...and gives an
              undertaking that he shall comply with such directions as may be
              given by the Court.
              <br />
              Section 438 of the CrPC too gives one amongst the several in vogue
              definitions of anticipatory bail in its title, to wit,
              anticipatory bail is a &quot;Direction for grant of bail to person
              apprehending arrest&quot;. Section 438 is reproduced hereunder.
              <br />
              Section 438 of CrPC: Direction for grant of bail to person
              apprehending arrest: [3]
              <br />
              Where any person has reason to believe that he may be arrested on
              accusation of having committed a non-bailable offence, he may
              apply to the High Court or the Court of Session for a direction
              under this section that in the event of such arrest he shall be
              released on bail; and that Court may, after taking into
              consideration, inter-alia, the following factors, namely-
              <br />
              the nature and gravity of the accusation; the antecedents of the
              applicant including the fact... ...he shall be released on bail,
              and if a Magistrate taking cognizance of such offence decides that
              a warrant should issue in the first instance against that person,
              he shall issue a bailable warrant in conformity with the direction
              of the Court under Sub-Section.
              <br />
              It would however be a good idea to remain present at the
              lawyer&apos;s office in order to provide your valuable inputs
              while the bail application is drafted, Also make sure that you
              keep in touch with your lawyer and that he informs you about the
              date of hearing of your bail application as and when he learns
              about it. It is a good idea for you to go to the court on the
              appointed day, just to be present while the lawyer makes his
              arguments, and to make sure that the lawyer is actively pursuing
              your case.
              <br />
              The judge will see how sharp and active your lawyer is. He may
              also read your bail application and may note the pertinent points,
              but very often judges do not bother to read the application in
              detail for small matters. A 498a anticipatory bail application is
              not a major matter for the judge with whom you are going to deal,
              because such applications can only be made to judges of sessions
              courts or high courts, and these judges are VIPs, especially High
              court judges, who deal with ministers and industrialists as a
              matter of routine.
              <br />
              The judge will consider whether you are a person who has some
              social standing. If you are a loafer or illiterate or a person
              with a bad reputation, then he will not give you anticipatory
              bail. There is a popular Hindi saying that it is worse to be
              considered a bad person than to just be a bad person. Do not think
              that you will get away in a situation where you are considered by
              your neighbours or by society to be a layabout just because the
              judge does not know you personally. In innumerable cases wives
              hire their own lawyers to assist and reinforce the prosecution,
              and this lawyer will do his best to make the judge feel that you
              are good for nothing.
              <br />
              Anticipatory bail cannot be granted to a person who has previously
              been convicted of an offence which carries a punishment which may
              exceed 7 years. Please note that this definition is slightly
              different from one involving an offence whose minimum punishment
              is 7 years or whose minimum punishment is more than 7 years. The
              bar is much lower than you would be comfortable with in case you
              have been convicted in a criminal case previously.When you apply
              for anticipatory bail after receiving notice of arrest, as
              described in the detailed article about anticipatory bail
              procedure in 498a cases, you will have to let your lawyer draft
              the bail application in a manner similar to the application which

              shall be released on bail; and that Court may, after taking into

              Any judge who grants you (or anyone else) bail has –when passing
              his order granting bail– the power to impose certain restrictions
              upon you (or upon the person in question) with respect to your
              behaviour during the period in which you are free on bail, while
              your 498a/406/34 trial (or criminal trial under any other
              section(s) of the IPC or under any other law) goes on in any
              (other) court. Let me rephrase that. The judge who grants you bail
              has the power to impose absolutely any lawful conditions which he
              / she deems fit.
              <br />
              This power has been given to judges by various provisions of the
              Criminal Procedure Code; notably by section 437 and 438. For the
              limited purpose of this current discussion we can say that while
              the latter section deals with accused persons who have applied for
              and obtained anticipatory bail, the former pertains to those
              people who manage to obtain bail after they have spent some time
              in custody, which in other words is to say that it pertains to
              people who have not managed to obtain anticipatory bail. This
              section (437 of the Criminal Procedure Code of India) may be
              adjudged as having been shoddily drafted, for reasons explained
              below.
              <br />
              Critique of Possible Bail Conditions u/s 437 of CrPC
              <br />
              Top of Page Section 437 lays down certain conditions which are
              compulsory in the event of bail being granted by any judge in the
              case of offences against the state (the offences and punishments
              pertaining to the offences listed under Chapter 6 of IPC),
              offences against the human body (the same items mutatis mutandis
              vis-à-vis Chapter 16 of IPC), and offences against property (the
              same items mutatis mutandis vis-à-vis Chapter 17 of IPC). Such
              conditions are also compulsory if a person is accused of
              attempting to, or conspiring to, or abetment of these offences.
              The conditions are also compulsory in the case of offences which
              are punishable by a sentence which may extend to 7 years or more
              in jail. The judge has no power to refuse to impose these
              conditions.
              <br />
              These conditions are three in number.
              <br />
              <br />
              The first condition is that the person who is bailed out needs to
              follow all the conditions which are mentioned in the bail bond
              executed by him under the relevant chapter. This expression
              &quot;bail bond executed by him under this chapter&quot; is
              confusing, and can be interpreted as being meaningless insofar as
              providing for the imposition of any specific set of conditions
              which are either not to be found or are not imposable in bail
              bonds executed under any other chapter (of the IPC) is concerned.
              (The confusion arises because of the reference to the various
              chapters of the IPC in the paragraph 437(3) of the CrPC. A better
              drafted law would have stated clearly &quot;bail bond executed by
              him under this chapter of the CrPC&quot; (which is to say, Chapter
              33 of the CrPC) instead of &quot;bail bond executed by him under
              this chapter&quot;.) Let me restate this in a simpler fashion.
              Conditions in a bail bond do not depend upon the chapter of the
              IPC (or of the CrPC for that matter) under which any specific
              offence pertaining to the bail application is to be found, or
              vice-versa. They are mostly the reasoned requirements (or whims
              and fancies) of courts and policemen. Due to this, this condition
              purports to be a fixed condition while in essence it gives the
              judge the power to set any legally permissible condition
              whatsoever. It is therefore a carte blanche to the judge (and to a
              limited extent to the police), and not really a fixed (in the
              sense of being a limited) condition.
              <br />
              The second condition which is compulsory under section 437 is that
              &quot;such person (the person who is being granted bail) shall not
              commit an offence similar to the offence of which he is accused,
              or suspected, of the commission of which he is suspected&quot;.
              The phrase &quot;of the commission of which he is suspected&quot;
              is superfluous and confusing in this clause. Basically all they
              needed to say in this second condition was that the person should
              not commit a fresh offence, and this too would have needed to have
              been said only in case they were being fastidious. To need to tell
              someone that they will lose their freedom if they commit a crime
              –similar or dissimilar to the one which they are accused of– is
              all good, and makes sense, if the person who you are talking to is
              a child. Not otherwise.A funny but not so funny thing about this
              clause, which many falsely accused men will note, is that this is
              a dangerous clause because the person who has been bailed out
              after being falsely accused can land in prison again upon a second
              false accusation. This is where section 437 and 438 come to the
              limited rescue of the accused person, insofar as he can use them
              to try to obtain bail in case he has not been convicted of certain
              types of offence in the past as explained in the article on this
              page. You can read an article about the procedure for AB on this
              page.
              <br />
              The third condition, and the only one which makes complete sense
              is &quot;that such person shall not directly or indirectly make
              any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with
              the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such
              facts to the Court or to any police officer or tamper with the
              evidence.&quot; This is entirely reasonable and is a welcome
              provision of law. Indeed, the falsely accused husband can
              reinforce his credentials in the eyes of the law to a certain
              extent by following this requirement to a T.
              <br />
              The judge/court has also been specifically given the power to
              impose additional conditions by section 437(3) of the CrPC by the
              following words at the end of the three clauses described above,
              &quot;and may also impose, in the interests of justice, such other
              conditions as it considers necessary.&quot; This is entirely
              unnecessary since clause (i) of 437(3) already grants this power
              to the court, as has been explained above in the explanation about
              that clause.
              <br />
              Remember that IPC 406 (Punishment for criminal breach of trust) is
              a provision for punishment for a crime against property, and is a
              provision of chapter 17 of the IPC. So the judge has no choice but
              to set the three conditions which are mentioned in section 437
              CrPC in case you apply (or are forced by circumstances to apply)
              for bail after spending some time in custody.
              <br />
              Critique of Possible Bail Conditions u/s 438 of CrPC
              <br />
              Top of Page These, so far described, are the conditions which are
              set in the case of bail which is not obtained in anticipation.
              Section 438 of CrPC deals with anticipatory bail, and it lays down
              the conditions which shall or may be set by any court which awards
              anticipatory bail to an accused person.
              <br />A reading of clause 438 (1b) (iv) gives the impression to
              the careless reader that all the conditions imposed by section 437
              are to be imposed on anybody obtaining anticipatory bail in a 498a
              case. This clause reads as follows– &quot;(iv) Such other
              condition as may be imposed under sub-section (3) of section 437,
              as if the bail were granted -under that section.&quot;
              <br />
              Such an impression is incorrect, as is much in the common
              man&apos;s understanding of the law. The critical word in this
              clause is &apos;may&apos;. The court has the power to impose any
              conditions which it deems fit, and this power comes to it via a
              reading of this clause with the relevant clauses of Section 437,
              but no condition is rendered compulsory by this clause or such
              reading.
              <br />
              There are three other (preceding) clauses in this section, none of
              which is compulsory. This is the reason why anticipatory bail is
              such a sought after relief, and also explains why it is
              potentially and usually a superior relief to the accused person
              than bail after arrest. <br />
              These clauses read as follows–
              <br />
              &quot;(i) a condition that the person shall make himself available
              for interrogation by a police officer and when required;
              <br />
              (ii) a condition that the person shall not, directly or
              indirectly,- make any inducement, threat or promise to any person
              acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from
              disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer,
              <br />
              (iii) a condition that the person shall not leave India without
              the previous permission of the court;&quot;
              <br />
              The second clause here has already been explained above, and is
              entirely reasonable in this writer&apos;s opinion. The first
              clause also appears to be entirely reasonable, and it may
              reasonably be wondered why this clause is not compulsory. The
              answer perhaps lies in the desire of the legislature to minimise
              discretionary powers of the police.
              <br />
              The third clause is of interest to the considerable number of 498a
              accused who are NRIs or PIOs. To preclude the possibility of this
              condition being imposed by the court hearing your AB application,
              make sure that your lawyer includes –in the prayer section of your
              application– a request to the court to not impose this condition
              on you should it decide to grant AB to you.

              Any judge who grants you (or anyone else) bail has –when passing
              his order granting bail– the power to impose certain restrictions
              upon you (or upon the person in question) with respect to your
              behaviour during the period in which you are free on bail, while
              your 498a/406/34 trial (or criminal trial under any other
              section(s) of the IPC or under any other law) goes on in any
              (other) court. Let me rephrase that. The judge who grants you bail
              has the power to impose absolutely any lawful conditions which he
              / she deems fit.
              <br />
              This power has been given to judges by various provisions of the
              Criminal Procedure Code; notably by section 437 and 438. For the
              limited purpose of this current discussion we can say that while
              the latter section deals with accused persons who have applied for
              and obtained anticipatory bail, the former pertains to those
              people who manage to obtain bail after they have spent some time
              in custody, which in other words is to say that it pertains to
              people who have not managed to obtain anticipatory bail. This
              section (437 of the Criminal Procedure Code of India) may be
              adjudged as having been shoddily drafted, for reasons explained
              below.
              <br />
              Critique of Possible Bail Conditions u/s 437 of CrPC
              <br />
              Top of Page Section 437 lays down certain conditions which are
              compulsory in the event of bail being granted by any judge in the
              case of offences against the state (the offences and punishments
              pertaining to the offences listed under Chapter 6 of IPC),
              offences against the human body (the same items mutatis mutandis
              vis-à-vis Chapter 16 of IPC), and offences against property (the
              same items mutatis mutandis vis-à-vis Chapter 17 of IPC). Such
              conditions are also compulsory if a person is accused of
              attempting to, or conspiring to, or abetment of these offences.
              The conditions are also compulsory in the case of offences which
              are punishable by a sentence which may extend to 7 years or more
              in jail. The judge has no power to refuse to impose these
              conditions.
              <br />
              These conditions are three in number.
              <br />
              The first condition is that the person who is bailed out needs to
              follow all the conditions which are mentioned in the bail bond
              executed by him under the relevant chapter. This expression
              &quot;bail bond executed by him under this chapter&quot; is
              confusing, and can be interpreted as being meaningless insofar as
              providing for the imposition of any specific set of conditions
              which are either not to be found or are not imposable in bail
              bonds executed under any other chapter (of the IPC) is concerned.
              (The confusion arises because of the reference to the various
              chapters of the IPC in the paragraph 437(3) of the CrPC. A better
              drafted law would have stated clearly &quot;bail bond executed by
              him under this chapter of the CrPC&quot; (which is to say, Chapter
              33 of the CrPC) instead of &quot;bail bond executed by him under
              this chapter&quot;.) Let me restate this in a simpler fashion.
              Conditions in a bail bond do not depend upon the chapter of the
              IPC (or of the CrPC for that matter) under which any specific
              offence pertaining to the bail application is to be found, or
              vice-versa. They are mostly the reasoned requirements (or whims
              and fancies) of courts and policemen. Due to this, this condition
              purports to be a fixed condition while in essence it gives the
              judge the power to set any legally permissible condition
              whatsoever. It is therefore a carte blanche to the judge (and to a
              limited extent to the police), and not really a fixed (in the
              sense of being a limited) condition.
              <br />
              The second condition which is compulsory under section 437 is that
              &quot;such person (the person who is being granted bail) shall not
              commit an offence similar to the offence of which he is accused,
              or suspected, of the commission of which he is suspected&quot;.
              The phrase &quot;of the commission of which he is suspected&quot;
              is superfluous and confusing in this clause. Basically all they
              needed to say in this second condition was that the person should
              not commit a fresh offence, and this too would have needed to have
              been said only in case they were being fastidious. To need to tell
              someone that they will lose their freedom if they commit a crime
              –similar or dissimilar to the one which they are accused of– is
              all good, and makes sense, if the person who you are talking to is
              a child. Not otherwise. A funny but not so funny thing about this
              clause, which many falsely accused men will note, is that this is
              a dangerous clause because the person who has been bailed out
              after being falsely accused can land in prison again upon a second
              false accusation. This is where section 437 and 438 come to the
              limited rescue of the accused person, insofar as he can use them
              to try to obtain bail in case he has not been convicted of certain
              types of offence in the past as explained in the article on this
              page. You can read an article about the procedure for AB on this
              page.
              <br />
              The third condition, and the only one which makes complete sense
              is &quot;that such person shall not directly or indirectly make
              any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with
              the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such
              facts to the Court or to any police officer or tamper with the
              evidence.&quot; This is entirely reasonable and is a welcome
              provision of law. Indeed, the falsely accused husband can
              reinforce his credentials in the eyes of the law to a certain
              extent by following this requirement to a T.
              <br /> The judge/court has also been specifically given the power
              to impose additional conditions by section 437(3) of the CrPC by
              the following words at the end of the three clauses described
              above, &quot;and may also impose, in the interests of justice,
              such other conditions as it considers necessary.&quot; This is
              entirely unnecessary since clause (i) of 437(3) already grants
              this power to the court, as has been explained above in the
              explanation about that clause.
              <br />
              Remember that IPC 406 (Punishment for criminal breach of trust) is
              a provision for punishment for a crime against property, and is a
              provision of chapter 17 of the IPC. So the judge has no choice but
              to set the three conditions which are mentioned in section 437
              CrPC in case you apply (or are forced by circumstances to apply)
              for bail after spending some time in custody.
              <br />
              Critique of Possible Bail Conditions u/s 438 of CrPC
              <br />
              Top of Page These, so far described, are the conditions which are
              set in the case of bail which is not obtained in anticipation.
              Section 438 of CrPC deals with anticipatory bail, and it lays down
              the conditions which shall or may be set by any court which awards
              anticipatory bail to an accused person.
              <br />A reading of clause 438 (1b) (iv) gives the impression to
              the careless reader that all the conditions imposed by section 437
              are to be imposed on anybody obtaining anticipatory bail in a 498a
              case. This clause reads as follows– &quot;(iv) Such other

              <br />
              Such an impression is incorrect, as is much in the common

              but no condition is rendered compulsory by this clause or such
              reading.
              <br />
              There are three other (preceding) clauses in this section, none of
              which is compulsory. This is the reason why anticipatory bail is
              such a sought after relief, and also explains why it is
              potentially and usually a superior relief to the accused person
              than bail after arrest. These clauses read as follows–
              <br />
              &quot;(i) a condition that the person shall make himself available
              for interrogation by a police officer and when required;
              <br />
              <br />
              (ii) a condition that the person shall not, directly or
              indirectly,- make any inducement, threat or promise to any person
              acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from
              disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer,
              <br />
              (iii) a condition that the person shall not leave India without
              the previous permission of the court;&quot;
              <br />
              The second clause here has already been explained above, and is
              entirely reasonable in this writer&apos;s opinion. The first
              clause also appears to be entirely reasonable, and it may
              reasonably be wondered why this clause is not compulsory. The
              answer perhaps lies in the desire of the legislature to minimise
              discretionary powers of the police.
              <br />
              The third clause is of interest to the considerable number of 498a
              accused who are NRIs or PIOs. To preclude the possibility of this
              condition being imposed by the court hearing your AB application,
              make sure that your lawyer includes –in the prayer section of your
              application– a request to the court to not impose this condition
              on you should it decide to grant AB to you.

              Like most things in life, there is an ever present duality in the
              criminal justice process. Being Indians, we are aware of Hindu
              culture and mythology. Hence we can relate to this concept very
              well. There is a never ending dialectic in legal philosophy
              between the right of the accused to be presumed innocent until
              proven guilty and the need of the complainant(s) or victim(s) for
              a fair trial, uninfluenced by powerful or nasty (or both) accused
              persons. Bail is a legal provision which has great potential to
              provide mischievous or criminal elements an opportunity to
              influence the course of a trial in all the wrong ways. Sometimes
              people are bailed out and they misuse their freedom. Bail
              cancellation is the most obvious post facto way in which such
              abuse can be curtailed.

              Different judges and benches have different views and ideologies
              in terms of their degree of concern for the rights of victims and
              accused. (All of us are also keenly aware that many forces which
              try to successfully or unsuccessfully influence judicial outcomes
              operate in our country legally and illegally.) General trends can
              also be discerned, arguably. The pendulum keeps swinging from the
              side of the accused to the side of the complainants. Earlier it
              was more on the side of the accused due to the absence of any
              credible checks on corruption in law enforcement. Now accused
              persons have to work their way through or around a powerful media
              and public opinion. This is achieved in various ways which are
              discussed in various other places on this website.
              <br />
              Bail can be cancelled after being granted. Bail cancellation is a
              provision which is included in sections 437(5) and section 439(2)
              of the Criminal Procedure Code.
              <br />
              Section 437(5) of CrPC — Any Court which has released a person on
              bail under sub- section (1) or sub- section (2), may, if it
              considers it necessary so to do, direct that such person be
              arrested and commit him to custody. [1]
              <br />
              Section 439(2) of CrPC — A High Court or Court of Session may
              direct that any person who has been released on bail under this
              Chapter be arrested and commit him to custody. [2]
              <br />
              This (cancellation of bail already granted) is usually possible
              only under such circumstances when the conditions which are set by
              the judge who granted bail have been violated by the accused.
              However, there can be any number of other circumstances under
              which this may be done. Such circumstances are not listed down
              anywhere. This is decided by judges keeping the facts and
              circumstances related to the crime and its aftermath in mind. Bail
              cancellation is just another one of an innumerable variety of
              things which are decided by courts in India by looking at the
              totality of facts and circumstances in the matter at hand. This is
              a fairly common legal concept, derivable intuitively by any
              thinking person.
              <br />
              Bail does not get automatically cancelled if an accused person
              violates his bail conditions. The prosecution side has to apply
              for cancellation of bail in the appropriate legal forum for such
              action. The Supreme Court had earlier taken the view that refusal
              to grant bail on the one hand, and cancellation of bail already
              granted on the other hand are two very different things, and
              should be treated as such. A double bench of the SC (A.S. Anand
              and M.K. Mukherjee) stated in Dolat Ram vs. State of Haryana, JT
              1995 (1) (SC) 127: (1995) 1 SCC 349: (1994) Supp 6 SCR 69: (1994)
              4 SCALE 1119 [3] that &quot;Rejection of bail in a non-bailable
              case at the initial stage and the cancellation of the bail so
              granted, have to be considered and dealt with on different basis.
              Very cogent and overwhelming circumstances are necessary for an
              order directing the cancellation of bail, already granted. The
              High Court it appears to us overlooked the distinction between the
              factors relevant for rejecting bail in a non-bailable case in the
              first instance and the cancellation of bail already
              granted.&quot;(sic)
              <br />
              This view was partly contradicted by another Supreme Court
              judgement made by Markandeya Katju and Gyan Sudha Mishra in 2011.
              In a matter related to a fake encounter (Prakash Kadam and ors.
              vs. Ramprasad Vishwanath Gupta and ors., AIR 2011 SC 1945) [4],
              Katju authored a judgement laden with emotions and quotes from
              Shakespeare and Ved Vyas on behalf of the bench of which he was a
              part. The operative part of the judgement in the present context
              is as follows, &quot;However, we are of the opinion that that is
              not an absolute rule, and it will depend on the facts and
              circumstances of the case. In considering whether to cancel the
              bail the Court has also to consider the gravity and nature of the
              offence, prima facie case against the accused, the position and
              standing of the accused, etc. If there are very serious
              allegations against the accused his bail may be cancelled even if
              he has not misused the bail granted to him. Moreover, the above
              principle applies when the same Court which granted bail is
              approached for cancelling the bail. It will not apply when the
              order granting bail is appealed against before an appellate /
              revisional Court.&quot; Here, the bench in the present case is
              referring to the rule laid down by Anand and Mukherjee when they
              say &quot;we are of the opinion that that is not an absolute
              rule…&quot;. Both judgements are being used as precedents by lower
              courts today since they were both made by two judge benches.
              <br />
              It is sometimes very difficult for the prosecution or the
              complainant(s) to obtain cancellation of bail already granted. Lt.
              Gen. Tejinder Singh has applied for cancellation of bail granted
              to Gen. V.K. Singh in the criminal defamation case filed by the
              former [5] [6]. He is unlikely to get a favourable order, since
              this is a private case and the allegation has not been accepted to
              be prima facie correct. Sanjeev Nanda&apos;s bail in the BMW case
              was not cancelled inspite of clear misdemeanour by his lawyer R.K.
              Dewan. Manu Sharma&apos;s interim bail was cancelled by the Delhi
              High Court after one of the prosecution witnesses vanished, but he
              later managed to get regular bail [7] [8]. This was in the Jessica
              Lal murder case. The special cell of Delhi Police tried to get
              Sreesanth&apos;s bail in the IPL T20 spot-fixing case cancelled
              with no success. Shakeel Noorani filed an independent petition for
              cancellation of bail granted to Sanjay Dutt in the Bombay blasts
              case [9]. The petition was rejected.
              <br />
              It is worth noting in the Sanjay Dutt case above that a third
              party which is not a part of the prosecution, nor a complainant
              may appeal for cancellation of bail in a criminal case. This is
              one aspect of criminal cases where such interventions are allowed.
              There are apparent contradictions in Supreme Court judgements in
              this regard. Justice P. Sathasivam and B.S. Chauhan stated in the
              above case that Noorani needed to file an FIR if he wished to
              resolve his financial dispute with Sanjay Dutt, instead of taking
              this route. They were also reported in the media (The Hindu,
              Chennai) as having said that “How is the producer involved in this
              (Mumbai blast) criminal case? You file an FIR. We are dismissing
              your petition.” On the face of it, this seems to fly against what
              was said in Rajpal vs. Jagvir Singh, 1979 All Cr Rep 514 [10]
              (Jai, J.R., Bail Law and Procedure, Universal Law Publishing
              Company, 2012, Delhi), wherein the Allahabad High Court held that
              the state was not the only eligible petitioner in any bail
              cancellation matter. Details of the judgment quoted by him in
              support of this weighty contention have not been supplied by Jai
              in his work, but they can be seen at at least one location on the
              internet [11]. It might be mentioned in the context of
              Noorani&apos;s bail cancellation application that sometimes the
              motives of litigants are not entirely transparent. This happens in
              all sorts of cases including PILs.
              <br />
              In R.Rathinam vs State By DSP, District Crime, [(2000) 2 SCC 391
              [12]], it was held by a division bench of the Supreme Court that a
              third party can file an application for cancellation of bail. In
              such a way the third party is reminding the court of the need to
              exercise its own power to start suo motu proceedings in this
              regard. The judges were K Thomas and D Mohapatra. Thus it is now
              the law that third parties can file such applications.
              <br />
              Sometimes bail cancellation occurs or appears to be likely. You
              might be aware of the current 2G case in which CBI is trying to
              get Sanjay Chandra&apos;s bail cancelled, after he was allegedly
              caught discussing his case with the public prosecutor A.K. Singh.
              There are media reports which suggest that CBI has a bulletproof
              case in this matter. (It is a different matter that the CBI failed
              in getting Chandra&apos;s bail cancelled in the said matter from a
              bench led by H.L. Dattu [13], but the case for the prosecution was
              substantially strengthened.) In the Uphaar cinema case the Ansals
              were accused of stealing and/or meddling with court documents and
              their bail was cancelled by the Supreme Court [14] as a
              consequence (they were later on accused of bench-hunting by the
              aggrieved parties, when they tried to get their bail cancellation
              overturned and did things which amounted to seeking a particular
              bench). Vijay Sai Reddy obtained bail in the Jaganmohan Reddy
              disproportionate assets case from the CBI trial court. The Supreme
              Court later cancelled his bail [15]. As recently as the month of
              May in the current year, R.K. Agrawal&apos;s bail in the 2012
              Rajya Sabha election cash-for-votes scam (Jharkhand) has been
              cancelled [16].
              <br />
              Something very different happened to S. Gopalakrishnan and V.S.
              Prabhakara Gupta in the Satyam Infoway corporate fraud case in
              which B. Ramalinga Raju is the main accused; the Supreme Court
              overruled the order of the High Court whereby they had been
              granted bail. This is different from cancellation of bail, as was
              explained in the reasoned order passed by P. Sathasivam and B.S.
              Chauhan. [17]. It must be mentioned however that the position
              taken by the two learned SC judges seems to be in direct
              opposition to the legal maxim that every bail order is a final
              order, and that the only way to challenge a positive bail order is
              an indirect way, which is to apply for cancellation of bail.
              <br />
              If you manage to get anticipatory bail in your 498a case (u/s
              498a/406/34 or as the case may be) then make sure that you follow
              all the conditions imposed upon you by the court scrupulously.
              Most important of all, do not contact or try to contact your
              accuser/accusers directly or indirectly. In fact, do not even
              mention her/them by name except in legal documents. Also, do not
              try to contact the public prosecutor at any time whatsoever
              before, during or after your trial. As far as the investigating
              officer is concerned, he will contact you himself whenever there
              is a need to do so. Do not try to initiate contact with him except
              under extraordinary circumstances. Another thing is that you need
              to make sure that the IO can contact you at all normal times.
              Above all remember the principle that an accused person should not
              try to influence the outcome of the trial in any manner except
              through his legal defence.
              <br />
              Bail is given in bailable cases as a matter of right. However it
              can be cancelled if the accused person is found to have tried to
              unduly influence the course of the case. Note that a magistrate
              can cancel bail granted by himself in a non-bailable matter, but
              he has no power to do so in a bailable case. Bail in such matters
              can only be cancelled by a sessions court or a higher court.
              <br />
              Another thing to be noted is that bail granted by a court can only
              be cancelled by a court which is equal or superior to it in the
              judicial hierarchy. This is applicable to all sorts of matters
              –bailable as well as non-bailable– with the proviso which is
              mentioned in the previous paragraph. A sessions court cannot
              cancel bail granted by a high court, and a high court cannot
              cancel bail granted by the Supreme Court. A single judge of the
              Supreme Court cannot cancel bail granted by a double bench of the
              same court. This last is applicable to high courts also.

              If you feel that your dowry case is bad and is causing you to make
              an unfair number of trips to various courts, have a look at the
              Jaganmohan Reddy case. God only knows how many bail applications
              he was forced to make before he finally got bail. Thrice his bail
              was rejected by the apex court [1] [2] [3]. So we can rightly
              conclude that he approached the SC four times just to get bail.
              There was one bail application made by him in the Supreme Court in
              which 13 lawyers were representing him, with 4 lawyers against.
              Many of these lawyers are heavyweight lawyers. Still his
              application was rejected. Many high profile cases have similar
              histories. Look at the Gopal Kanda [4] [5] [6] case for example,
              or the slowly unfolding Asaram Bapu case [7] [8] [9].
              <br />
              The principle of res judicata is broadly speaking not applicable
              to bail applications. This is to say that judicial precedent
              cannot be used as a tool by a bail applicant to get bail. Every
              bail application is deemed to have its own fresh set of facts and
              circumstances which need to be examined by the presiding judge
              before he gives his considered opinion in the form of a decision
              one way or the other. An applicant is free to apply for bail at a
              higher court if his application is rejected by a lower court.
              Often higher courts tell accused persons to go back to the lower
              court whence they came, and the accused is forced to make a fresh
              application (including modifications determined by the higher
              court order) at the lower court.
              <br />
              If the lower court rejects his application, he goes to a higher
              court. If it is rejected again at this level, then he goes to the
              local high court. If the application is rejected here too, he has
              to apply at the Supreme Court. The applicant may be told to go
              back to the immediately lower court or to the lowest court to make
              a fresh and modified application at each of the successive higher
              stages. This makes for possibly an innumerable quantity of bail
              applications, and would be sufficient to clog up any legal system.
              <br />
              But our system is not satisfied with this amount of litigation.
              This whole exercise may produce only an interim bail order at its
              end. Interim bail is not final bail, as is clear from its name. A
              final bail order will require another bail application which will
              need to travel from the bottom to the top of the court system.
              This is enough fodder for another vexing round of lucrative
              litigation, which the accused person has no option but to initiate
              in case he loves his freedom. It needs to be mentioned just to
              make things clear that the litigation is vexing for one person,
              and lucrative for another person. This round of applications may
              finally end in a bail order. For the purpose of this write-up we
              better assume that it does, lest we keep going around in circles.
              <br />
              However, this is not the end of it. The bail order obtained by the
              accused is not final. There is in fact no concept of finality in
              bail orders. The prosecution is free to start appealing for
              cancellation of bail now. They can start with the court which
              granted bail, and go right up to the Supreme Court. It is not
              unheard of that a prosecution filed its petition for cancellation
              of bail at a court other than the court which had granted bail,
              only to be told to appeal at the correct forum. Sometimes
              incompetent or careless or less than alert lawyers file petitions
              in courts which do not have jurisdiction, and are told to approach
              the court which has jurisdiction over the matter at hand. This
              causes further mental torture and wasted time for all concerned.
              However, applying at the right court does not guarantee a
              favourable order. This much is axiomatic in litigation. Then the
              aggrieved party has no other option than either to give up or to
              approach a higher authority. This shooting match can continue
              right up to the Supreme Court.It must be mentioned here that often
              a higher court including and up to the Supreme Court puts an
              embargo on further bail applications for a limited period bounded
              by specific events like the filing of a chargesheet, or completion
              of investigation, or until a certain date defined by the
              performance or non-performance of a specific action or act. When
              the time comes, the litigant starts the whole circus all over
              again, in the process benefitting criminal lawyers by fattening
              their pension fund. If the investigating agency drags its feet and
              does not complete the investigation within a reasonable amount of
              time, the litigant makes a fresh application regardless of and
              without waiting for such completion.
              <br />
              If a person gets convicted then he has the right to apply for stay
              of his sentence or for bail pending the decision on his appeal in
              a higher court. Such persons usually file bail applications, and
              this phenomenon is especially widespread in 498a cases. This is
              done under a different section of the CrPC than the original bail
              application. Incidentally, even anticipatory bail and regular bail
              are applied for and granted under separate sections of the CrPC.
              If an accused person files bail applications under different
              sections of the CrPC then he has to litigate anew at each stage
              with the same rigmarole ahead of him. I forgot to mention that
              even notice bail applications are eligible to be litigated till
              the highest level, and are treated as a different bail
              application, even though they are filed under the same section of
              the CrPC which is applicable to anticipatory bail.
              <br />
              Transit bail and interim bail are two kinds of bail which
              guarantee the need for further bail applications. Yes, sometimes
              an accused files specifically for interim bail, surprising as it
              may sound. All bail applications are heard on an urgent basis by
              all courts. This is a priority which is not even granted to writ
              petitions, except some specific types of writ petitions, like a
              habeas corpus petition for example. This includes interim bail
              extension applications too. All this is done in the name of
              protecting the accused person&apos;s right to life guaranteed by
              Article 21 of the Constitution. It is very interesting that the
              state is not bothered about the violation of the right to life
              which is suffered by people who are trapped in unhappy marriages
              or are held to ransom by rogue tenants sitting on property
              purchased with lawfully earned money, in the sense that people who
              belong to these categories are commonly forced to litigate for 20
              years, 30 years, or more. Is it possible that this is happening
              because bail applications are a lucrative business for the legal
              community? Bail applications make up the major part of the
              practice of most criminal lawyers, and each bail application is
              more often than not paid for by the client separately from the
              main criminal trial case.

              <br />
              There are many variations of a commonly heard saying in India
              which goes, &quot;Once you start one or more of the following, you
              can never be sure how much you will end up spending:-
              hospitalisation, legal proceedings, and house construction.&quot;
              This saying is incorrect on all three fronts for the prudent
              person. Here we will talk about how to get your lawyer to perform
              as per your requirements, and within your budget. The only
              condition (which incidentally goes without saying) here is that it
              is essential to keep your requirements and budget realistic, lest
              you put yourself at risk of facing guaranteed disappointment.
              <br />
              Do not give in easily when faced with the threat of a 498a case.
              Let the other party (your &apos;wife&apos;) work to get their
              money. Let the lawyer also work for his money. This game is about
              money, it is not about sending you to jail. It is equally true
              that you cannot fight this battle alone, and a good lawyer is
              indispensable for you if you wish to remain sane throughout the
              ups and downs of your legal war. Do not neglect to conduct some
              market research and talking on the phone and in person with two or
              three lawyers before narrowing down your choices and / or settling
              for one.

              Fee Enquiries And Initial Spadework
              <br />
              Top of Page Do not waste time on trying to find out lawyers&apos;
              fees over the phone. Most of them will insist that they cannot
              tell you even a rough idea of their fee until you visit their
              office. Exceptions are possible if they have worked for you before
              or if they work near your house, i.e the lawyer is your neighbour.
              At the same time remember that prudent lawyers do not give
              absolutely any information over the phone except to provide a time
              for an appointment. This is done by successful lawyers to prevent
              time wastage and by struggling lawyers to preclude armchair
              comparison shopping by people who are unlikely to give real paid
              business to their offices. Another reason for them to do this is
              to see the potential client face to face in order to judge what
              kind of person he is. Remember, it is not just the lawyer who
              becomes an important person for his client for an extended period.
              The client likewise becomes a constant presence in the life of his
              lawyer for a long time. Therefore it should not be surprising if a
              lawyer seeks to know his client very well before starting a long
              term relationship with him / her / them.
              <br />
              If any lawyer asks for money for even the first consultation, then
              make enquiries about his reputation before spending money on him.
              You might even try to find out what he will charge for the case
              –in case you decide to engage him– before you go for the first
              meeting, but such efforts do not always yield results. Such is the
              nature of the Beast. Not that normally only very good lawyers ask
              for money for the first meeting. This is done to weed out
              financially unsound clients and clients who are unwilling to pay,
              and is done at the first stage itself as you can see. Call it a
              sort of lawyers&apos; substitute for face control. This can be
              waived by many of them if you go via any of their former clients
              –the reasoning being that former clients are unlikely to recommend
              undesirable clients.
              <br />
              The argument that lawyers who do not charge for the first meeting
              are cheaper usually turns out to be misconceived if you consider
              the longer run. Lawyers who charge for the very first consultation
              are less likely to throw wool over your eyes than so called free
              consultation providers. Allow me to elaborate.
              <br />
              There is a common trend these days of various NGOs and lawyers
              claiming to provide free consultation. There is a simple test to
              check their intentions. If they provide free advice on telephone
              then they are more likely to be genuine than if they insist on a
              visit to their office for such &apos;free&apos; advice. They know
              like everybody else that if a client goes to visit them for any
              sort of advice then he is forced to skip at least half a day at
              his job, and to spend five or six hundred rupees on petrol
              –thereby causing a small financial expenditure. It is common
              psychology to not waste time on further enquiries because each
              enquiry costs money and time, and therefore the NGO in question
              can reasonably expect you to become their client. This can happen
              in the case of certain types of lawyers also.
              <br />
              Another trick is to promise low fees initially and then to
              complicate the client&apos;s case with a view to extorting more
              fees and / or prolonging litigation. This is the commonest trick
              in our country. It is not wrong to blame lawyers for this
              situation but at least part of the reason for this state of
              affairs is a general reluctance amongst members of the public to
              pay unless forced to pay. Read the section about how not to become
              the client from hell below to learn more about difficult clients.

              Qualities Of A Good Lawyer
              <br />
              Top of Page
              <br />
              Does the lawyer have his own office or does he share a chamber
              with a senior or a more successful lawyer? As a rule only sign
              agreements with lawyers who have their own office or chamber
              because it is foolhardy to engage a lawyer who does not have a
              permanent work address. Has he graduated from an unknown college?
              Avoid lawyers who seem to have gone to a degree shop to get their
              Ll.B. How comfortable is he with the language of litigation? He
              will be unable to produce good petitions or to argue smoothly in
              court if he does not have good English.
              <br />
              Does he have any associates? If there is nobody else in his office
              then it will become impossible for you to get answers to your
              queries, to get somebody to represent you in court, or to answer
              any urgent correspondence in his absence. Is his / her practice
              based on assembly line and / or wholesale rate litigation? It will
              be impossible to get personalised attention from such a practice.
              <br />
              Does he give an impression of being a sophisticated person?
              Bargaining for the lowest possible payoff to your disaffected wife
              is an integral part of most modern day marital litigation, and
              therefore it always helps to have a shrewd, perceptive ally. Bear
              in mind that if you end up paying twenty lakh rupees less than her
              demand to your wife and simultaneously are forced to spend one or
              two lakhs extra on the kind of lawyer who enables you to clinch
              the aforementioned bargain then you cannot say that you have
              overpaid your lawyer. At the same time remember that a fool and
              his money are easily parted so it is best to not be a fool.
              <br />
              Does the lawyer have a comfortable office? His office will become
              an oft visited place during your litigation. You probably do not
              wish to stand in the sun or rain while waiting for your turn.
              Neither is it enjoyable to sit on uncomfortable chairs or in a non
              air-conditioned office.
              <br />
              The Cost Of Litigation
              <br />
              Top of Page
              <br />A very common question from readers is to ask about the cost
              / fees for litigation of various types including inter alia
              expected legal fees for anticipatory bail, divorce cases, mutual
              consent cases, criminal trials, civil claims, writ petitions, etc.
              <br />
              There is no fixed answer for such questions but a general rule of
              thumb can be stated. The greater the competence, knowledge, and
              experience of a lawyer, the greater the demand for him; the
              greater the probability of winning, the greater the fee. Lawyers
              like KTS Tulsi, Mukul Rohtagi, Ram Jethmalani, Harish Salve,
              Kamini Jaiswal etc. can command fees approaching 25 to 35 lakh
              rupees per appearance in court. Jolly Ll.b. characters can ask for
              ten thousand rupees for bail matters and then promptly cause their
              clients to go to jail. Successful senior lawyers with offices in
              very good localities can charge anywhere from 2 lakhs to 8 lakh
              rupees for entire cases and 1 lakh to 3 lakhs for bail /
              anticipatory bail matters.
              <br />
              Matrimonial litigation packages may cost from 2 lakh rupees to 10
              lakh rupees depending not only upon the ability and experience of
              the concerned lawyer but also upon how much he or she is in
              demand. Notice bail plus Anticipatory bail matters for dowry and
              other simple cases for two to three levels of courts may cost from
              35 thousand rupees to 1.5 lakh rupees if handled by a decent
              lawyer, with the upper limit being around ten lakh rupees for any
              former additional solicitor general. This is the situation as of
              early 2017.
              <br />
              The Vakalat / Vakalatnama Top of Page Make a clear financial
              agreement with the lawyer when you make your decision to engage
              him. Usually such agreements are verbal but they are honoured.
              This will help you to keep your costs predictable. However,
              remember that once you have given X amount of money, you cannot
              get any part of X back. This is true in most countries including
              especially poor countries like India.
              <br />
              In addition note that when you sign your first vakalatnama with a
              particular lawyer, he is obliged to submit it to the court. It has
              seldom been heard that any lawyer backed out after he submitted
              the vakalatnama to the court, or that any lawyer refused to submit
              a vakalatnama to the court after getting it signed by a client.
              You may wish to include a line in the vakalatnama that you have
              paid the full and final fees. Alternatively, you may request a
              note from the lawyer saying that he has received the full and
              final payment for the particular case. This is because legal fees
              are mostly paid in cash, and lawyers are reluctant to give a
              receipt for the exact amount received, although exceptions are
              fairly common.
              <br />
              Some lawyers are allergic to giving you a copy of the vakalatnama,
              but most of them are not, in this writer&apos;s experience. Good
              lawyers also give you copies of all your case documents upon
              request. (It is interesting how the legal profession has protected
              itself. Architects sign an agreement with their clients in which
              both parties sign. A lawyer does not sign that he has agreed to
              represent you, even though you are paying him for it. He rather
              makes you sign that you are agreeing to let him represent you. The
              law (made by lawyers) permits lawyers to do this.) If you
              initially started with a per case payment system with your lawyer,
              consider going in for a package deal for all related litigation as
              the legal costs start mounting. If you are going in for a package
              deal, make sure that there is an instalment system for payments.
              Usually the lawyer takes full payment for each case at the rack
              rate as soon as the vakalatnama is signed for that particular
              case, and when the cumulative payments reach the total package
              amount which was initially agreed, he stops taking further
              payment.
              <br />
              It may be clarified here that often a client is told that,
              &quot;You have already paid the rack rate for the first case or
              first few cases, and I have started work on those cases. The meter
              for your package deal will start ticking after you sign up for a
              package deal, and the money paid earlier is gone into my account,
              and I am not going to count it towards your package.&quot; So the
              package very often is for the cases to be fought AFTER the cases
              which went by before you finalised a package. Some people (usually
              lawyers) feel that this is fair, while others (usually clients)
              don&apos;t think so.
              <br />
              One variation of the package deal is that the lawyer agrees to
              take a lesser amount if the litigation does not escalate beyond a
              certain quantity, and the full amount if it exceeds that limit.
              <br />
              Another thing to keep in mind is case filing charges, which
              include court fees and preparing copies of the documents. This is
              an irritating additional expense, which gets on the
              litigant&apos;s nerves, and the unpleasantness is totally
              avoidable by including these charges within the initial package
              agreement. But a surprisingly high percentage of lawyers uses this
              head to milk the client further. It helps the lawyer that the
              court does not give any receipt for court fees, which is paid by
              purchasing and affixing stamps of varying amounts. You may fix a
              per case (or per case/appeal filing) additional fee under this
              head, with the amounts being in increasing slabs per case
              depending upon whether that case is filed in a lower court or a
              higher court.
              <br />
              In this writer&apos;s opinion, any lawyer who charges extra for
              documentation, photocopying, and/or mailing documents to you is
              not worth his salt. Make sure you cover this head in your fee
              negotiation, and that you include a clause that no surprise
              charges will be demanded at any stage. You may consider agreeing
              to pay with the condition that no more fees will be payable upto
              and after all legal options have been exhausted in a particular
              matter or set of matters.
              <br />
              Many lawyers ask for a lump sum signing amount, and then a per
              appearance fee. This system works out to be more expensive
              usually, and the costs are not predictable in this. Further, there
              is less incentive in this case for the lawyer to bring the
              litigation to as quick an end as legally possible. Lawyers also
              sometimes charge for every date on which they reach the court,
              regardless of the attendance of the opposing lawyer or the judge
              on that date. This is not a good practice because days on which
              particular judges are going to stay on leave are invariably
              announced in advance, more often than not announced on the
              internet.
              <br />
              Too Many Lawyers? Or Too Few Good Lawyers?
              <br />
              Top of Page
              <br />
              If you are dealing with a big firm of lawyers, it may not be a bad
              idea to sometimes slip a note to the youngsters who appear on
              behalf of the firm on your dates if they do a good job. They are
              usually underpaid and overworked. Law is a very exploitative
              profession, just like the rest of professions in India. Remember
              that the number of lawyers is more than the number of architects,
              chartered accountants, engineers, and doctors, combined. Almost
              any tom dick or harry can become a lawyer in our country.
              <br />
              Remember, the legal profession is very competitive, and there is
              cutthroat competition to get work. Most lawyers are not able to
              make ends meet, and therefore (theoretically?) the temptation to
              cheat and to cut corners is very high. Many people say that it is
              better to hire a lawyer who is successful, and has a brisk if not
              roaring practice. He is &quot;likely to be scared of losing his
              reputation and practice, and is practically guaranteed to not
              fight from both sides at the same time&quot;. Others might say
              that a lawyer can only be judged by his past performance. Such
              people are likely to prefer established attorneys.
              <br />
              An alternative logic is that the richer a lawyer, the greedier he
              will be. I personally feel that if a lawyer is needy enough to
              advertise, then he may be given a chance. There are many forums in
              which lawyers advertise today, because advertising has been
              permitted by their bar council.

              Suspecting The Motives Of Your Lawyer
              <br />
              Top of Page
              <br />A large number of lawyers are unscrupulous, and they scare
              their clients to make more money. Sometimes you may encounter two
              lawyers in the real or virtual world, who may or may not be
              partners, one of whom scares you and the other calms you down, and
              soothes your nerves, or offers you a cigarette. The idea here is
              for you to start trusting the one who calms you down; to pay him
              for trusting him. It is a surprisingly common phenomenon, with
              even very good lawyers engaging in this game. It is analogous to
              the old &apos;good cop, bad cop&apos; routine. This is a childish
              attempt to fool you, do not get fooled by this game. Remember,
              however, that your agenda is to avoid losing too much money, and
              not to insult or punish the lawyers who indulge in such
              manoeuvres. Therefore, do not accuse them of cheating to their
              face. This is not polite. Remember to always be courteous to all
              the people you meet during the course of your legal battle -even
              behind their backs. It is bad enough that you wife has become your
              enemy, and you should not try to add your lawyer to the list.
              <br />
              If you find yourself suspecting your lawyer&apos;s behaviour, or
              if you find yourself suspecting the behaviour of a very large
              percentage of people who you meet in the course of your legal
              battle, consider visiting a qualified psychiatrist. It is easy to
              say that the whole system is corrupt, and that they are all out to
              cheat you. It is also easy to argue for the opposite of this by
              saying that you are paranoid, and nobody is out to get you except
              your wife. Some people may even quote the postmodern saying that
              just because you are paranoid, it doesn&apos;t mean that they are
              not out to get you (in an attempt to confuse you, or because they
              themselves are confused). The bottomline is that if you are
              seriously disturbed then you need to meet a psychiatrist, before
              things get out of hand and you or someone close to you makes any
              stupid or dangerous attempt.
              <br />
              Sacking Your Lawyer
              <br />
              Top of Page Never fear that dismissing your lawyer may lead to
              your going to jail. If you and your family are convinced that the
              lawyer is not doing his job well, then sack him immediately, and
              tell twenty people. The law gives tremendous protection to you
              from any attempt by your former lawyer to send you to jail.
              However, lawyers can also be criminals. He may try something
              stupid. But he may very well find himself behind bars if he
              attempts something stupid. The worst you can expect in more than
              99 percent of such cases is a civil dispute. Even this is
              practically unheard of, as who will hire a lawyer who is known to
              have sued his own former client.
              <br /> According to the Bar Council rules, you cannot change you
              lawyer unless the first lawyer gives you a certificate stating
              that his dues have been cleared. This rarely works in this manner.
              Even in the famous rape case, the defendants switched back and
              forth between two lawyers at will. Just give a vakalatnama to a
              new lawyer, and inform the old one if you feel like informing him.
              Any prudent lawyer will not prolong his professional embarrassment
              by litigating for small amounts of money in such situations.
              <br /> A slightly more Sophisticated Way to Sack Your Lawyer
              <br /> Top of Page
              <br />
              Another way to sack your lawyer is to appoint an additional lawyer
              for your case without sacking the first one. You can continue to
              talk to the first lawyer or to start ignoring him totally. Also it
              is entirely up to you whether you want the both of them to appear
              on your behalf on various court dates. How much instruction you
              provide to each of them is also your prerogative. This method is
              recommended for that type of client who is a stickler for rules
              and feels that a no objection certificate from a sacked lawyer is
              essential if he is to be replaced. This method is also useful if a
              client falls into the clutches of a lawyers&apos; mafia –something
              which is seen all too commonly in our country.
              <br /> A Client&apos;s Role In Fighting His Own Case Top of Page A
              client invariably needs to contribute to drafting of petitions
              unless and until he engages a stratospherically expensive lawyer.
              Many many lawyers are good at courtroom tactics and oral arguments
              if they are briefed well, and are given a well prepared petition.
              However, very few are able to do both the drafting of the petition
              and the courtroom part well. If you are poor enough to need to
              read this article in minute detail, then you are probably not rich
              enough to afford a lawyer who will draft all your petitions,
              applications, replies, rejoinders, notices, agreements, and MoUs
              competently without requiring heavy contribution from your side.
              <br /> Most lawyers are too busy or too incompetent to draft your
              petitions and applications themselves. Since you are going for a
              lawyer who is successful and affordable at the same time, do not
              expect him to have time to draft these documents. Expect to spend
              your time and energy in this effort. Or you may ask a friend who
              can write well to do this for you. All the same, make sure that
              your lawyer goes through the petition before it is finalised.
              There is also normally at least one person whose main job is to
              draft petitions in any medium sized lawyers&apos; office. Give a
              chance to this person also to contribute to the drafting, although
              he will usually be working in an assembly line fashion. Get
              suggestions from your parents and really trusted people also.
              <br /> Remember to call the lawyer&apos;s office before the
              hearing date, and to talk to whoever is going to appear on your
              behalf. Brief this person well, and tell him any details which are
              important for you, but which you feel are too nuanced or sensitive
              to deserve a place in the written petition.
              <br /> If phone companies had to rely on outgoing calls by lawyers
              to make their money, they would pretty quickly go out of business.
              Most lawyers never call their clients. Most of them don&apos;t
              even return your calls. A huge percentage of successful ones are
              very difficult to raise on a phone in any manner which may be
              called satisfactory. If you meet a lawyer who calls you or even
              returns your calls, consider yourself lucky, and give him
              additional points for this courtesy.
              <br /> Some lawyers are very particular about not wanting to hear
              anything extraneous to the litigation from you. (This is usually
              the sign of a good lawyer.) Some of them are even chary of letting
              you tell them why you wish to take a particular step –especially
              when you wish to withdraw your petition or to compromise– and may
              demand instructions in written form from you in such situations.
              You may try to discuss each such step with your lawyer –before you
              make a decision either way– instead of presenting it as a fait
              accompli, in case you are willing to be persuaded.
              <br /> The Client From Hell
              <br /> Top of Page
              <br /> Also, try not to become the client from hell, a very common
              species in India. This person says right up front that he has very
              little money or no money to pay the lawyer, and then does his best
              to not pay him in the stages according to the agreement. If you
              want free legal services then you need to contact the free legal
              aid cell at the local court, and not go to an independent counsel
              who is working on retainer basis. Such clients are very common and
              this is one of the main reasons why most lawyers try to take their
              whole payment in advance. As an architect I have seen how
              difficult it is to extract fees from most clients in our country.
              This is why many professionals concentrate on foreign clients, and
              this is the reason why lawyers sometimes resort to putting their
              clients in a bad legal situation in order to scare them into
              paying them.
              <br /> Another thing this sort of client does is to mistrust his
              lawyer almost all the time and thus hinders him on his path to
              success in the case.
              <br /> No Surefire Formula For Handling Lawyers Top of Page It
              appears that clients do not handle lawyers. Rather, lawyers handle
              clients. It is probably best to somehow try to find a lawyer who
              has a record of treating his clients well. It must be mentioned
              here that many men who face dowry charges are really worthless
              people, and deserve the treatment which their wives give them. But
              lawyers are sharp and they know who is good and who is bad. They
              should use this knowledge to treat people accordingly.{" "}

              <br /> Men who face cruelty from their wives, and then decide to
              take legal steps to end that cruelty have to follow the path
              prescribed by law and society. Similarly, men who face criminal
              charges filed by their wives against them and possibly their
              parents are left with no option but to defend themselves against
              such allegations in at least one court of law, and sometimes in a
              series of courts or several courts simultaneously. Matrimonial
              litigation is often a combination of civil and criminal
              litigation. It is also an emotional battle. As such it needs to be
              dealt with at various fora including courts, police stations, and
              family.
              <br /> A litigant&apos;s lawyer&apos;s office becomes an often
              visited place for him, and his lawyer becomes a very important
              person in his life. His freedom and his happiness start to depend
              upon his lawyer&apos;s performance, competence, and bona fide
              intentions. If a lawyer is incompetent then he should have no
              right to call himself a lawyer. Sadly, such
              &apos;professionals&apos; are very common in our country due to
              the bar council&apos;s uncooperative attitude. If a lawyer is
              polite and he cheats his clients then he falls in the category of
              a smooth criminal. If a lawyer is rude on top of being a cheat
              then he is a practitioner of blatant thuggery. It is difficult to
              say which kind out of these three is a greater joy, since they all
              have their own charms. Litigants often realise quite late in the
              day that such lawyers are very common in our country. As a matter
              of fact there are many many lawyers who fall in at least two out
              of these three categories, and many many who meet all three
              criteria, i.e incompetence, dishonesty, and rudeness.
              <br /> In other countries also such lawyers are fairly common, as
              can be made out from the worldwide prevalence of jokes about
              lawyers which never show them in a positive light. Mario Puzo is
              not the only man in history who has referred to lawyers as
              thieves. Thinkers without number have put lawyers in the same
              category as prostitutes. Every second lawyer will warn you that
              his profession is chock a block with opportunists and unethical
              persons. This is but a soft way of calling somebody a criminal.
              Many people classify lawyers as traitors. This is out of anger at
              those lawyers who collude with the other party. Yes, it is an open
              secret that lawyers sometimes cheat their clients in the most
              detestable way, which is to sabotage their litigation by leaking
              information to their enemies or rivals. A friend of this writer
              once said to him that lawyers are one of the two professions where
              a person cannot succeed if he does not cheat –the other being
              goldsmithery.
              <br /> The first time litigant is often an innocent waiting for
              these gentlemen to pounce upon him. Such a person goes into
              litigation with the notion that his lawyer will fight the case
              competently and will do his best to make the courts give him
              justice. Experienced litigants have often been heard to say that
              it is the litigant who fights his case, and it is he who wins or
              loses his case, and not the lawyer. It would have been tolerable
              if things were bad only to this extent. The fact is that there is
              no shortage of incompetent lawyers who spoil the cases of their
              clients due to lack of knowledge of the law. Innumerable lawyers
              are actually cheats who spoil the cases of their clients. Such
              lawyers do not come into the public eye because the litigant does
              not wish to add more litigation to his legal troubles.
              <br /> Let me clarify this point. In our country a client cannot
              complain against his lawyer to the bar council in the normal
              format of a complaint. He actually has to file a petition and to
              engage a lawyer to fight this case. This is a sad situation. The
              bar council is not so stupid that it cannot see that a person who
              has been let down by one lawyer will think a thousand times before
              engaging another lawyer. This is a provision which has been framed
              by lawyers to favour lawyers, much like all the laws in our
              country. India is a republic of the lawyers, for the lawyers and
              by the lawyers if truth be told. Just see the number of lawyers in
              parliament and the union cabinet to get a rough assessment of
              their power in lawmaking, and policy formulation and execution.
              Even when we decided to give the title &apos;founding
              fathers&apos; to some people, we gave it a group of lawyers (I am
              not challenging their honesty or good intentions here partly
              because I value my health) like Gandhi, Jinnah, Ambedkar, Patel,
              Nehru, Rajendra Prasad, Lokmanya Tilak, and others. The third part
              of our polity –the judiciary– is totally composed of lawyers. If
              Sibal and Chidambaram go out, Jaitley and Ravishanka Prasad come
              in; if RK Anand goes out, KTS Tulsi comes in; if Narasimha Rao
              goes out, Pranab Mukherjee comes in. his writer has a reasonable
              amount of experience in litigation. He has met lawyers who are
              competent, lawyers who are courteous, and yes, lawyers who are
              honest. But he is yet to meet first hand any lawyer who meets all
              three desiderata. If you include the additional requirement of
              reasonable fees on top of these three then heaven help you. Even
              within my matrimonial litigation I have had to change lawyers a
              couple of times.
              <br /> The thing is that lawyers are highly aware that any man who
              comes to them is a man who is already neck deep in trouble and/or
              pain and/or grief, and does not have the energy or the strength to
              fight back if they harass and exploit him. This is the reason why
              lawyers are sometimes compared to birds of prey or carrion eaters.
              I personally have the experience of a firm of lawyers who were
              handling more than a thousand cases when I engaged them for my
              matrimonial litigation and they just took my money and then
              started treating me like an unwanted person, until the day when I
              was forced to sack them. I remember having the distinct feeling
              that perhaps they were behaving in an incompetent and rude way to
              encourage me to sack them. This has an eerie resemblance to the
              modus operandi of a cheat, but there is nothing much that a
              litigant can do to such people because he has other problems which
              are more urgent.
              <br /> Another thing which many lawyers do is to send their
              clients on a wild goose chase by misguiding them. In matrimonial
              litigation, often lawyers fool their clients by telling them that
              a petition for restitution of conjugal rights will bring some
              legal benefits to them like making them immune to dowry harassment
              charges u/s 498a IPC, or saving time, or obtaining a quick
              divorce. Other ways are to not defend their client using common
              sense logical arguments in court by providing specious legal
              arguments in chamber and/or by forcing the client to take devious
              legal routes. As a matter of fact a large percentage of people
              face more harassment from their lawyers than their spouses in
              matrimonial litigation.
              <br /> A simple question which you need to ask yourself is why
              will a lawyer try to end litigation quickly if he is benefitting
              from protracted litigation. This is just like expecting a realtor
              to get a lower price for you when his payment is tied to the
              price. People try to avoid such a situation by buying a package
              from a lawyer. This does not always work, as you have read above.
              <br /> Another common tactic of lawyers is to scare a litigant, or
              to fan the fire of needless litigation by invoking the anger,
              greed, or ego of their clients. I am told that it is not unheard
              of in lawyers&apos; offices in India that a client has been
              referred to as a murga(sacrificial chicken). Needless litigation
              is sometimes called luxury litigation in the legal profession. The
              bar council rules for lawyers specifically forbid them from
              encouraging needless or frivolous litigation, but this directive
              is flouted every day by a huge number of lawyers. This is
              especially true in matrimonial litigation.
              <br /> Many lawyers expect their client to address them as
              &apos;sir&apos; or &apos;madam&apos;, and in return they only give
              contempt to their clients, addressing him with the familiar
              &apos;you&apos; (tu) in Hindi, and treating them with disdain. My
              previous lawyers were inveterate practitioners of such rudeness
              even with clients who were ten years older than them. It is seen
              very often that such lawyers do not respect their colleagues and
              juniors also. No junior stays in their office for more than a few
              months. Everybody needs respect and fair treatment, but this fact
              is not recognised by such morons.
              <br /> A very large number of lawyers are over-argumentative. Such
              lawyers are weak in arguing in front of judges but love to argue
              with their clients constantly. They are habituated to deriving
              sadistic pleasure from the helplessness of their clients. Their
              aim inter alia is to keep the said clients wrongfooted in order
              that they can keep financially exploiting them in their respective
              states of confusion. If the victim of such a lawyer tries to argue
              back with logic the poor fellow discovers to his frustration that
              the gentleman has perfected the art of being on both sides of
              every argument, of staying on both sides of every fence, of never
              taking a stand, and of constantly resiling from his own stated
              positions. Stay away from such losers who as I have mentioned are
              legion.

              13 Reasons why Lawyers in India should be allowed to Advertise
            </h3>
            <div className="flex w-10 item-cenmter justify-center ">

            <p className="flex justify-center ">
              <br /> The Bar Council of India has finally allowed lawyers to
              advertise their services on the internet in this era of
              globalization. This move has come late as firms abroad have been
              advertising their services since more than a decade. This decision
              was informed by the BCI to the Supreme Court after an affidavit
              was filed through its secretary Mr. S. Radhakrishnan. However, as
              decided in the case of V.B. Joshi v. Union of India, where this
              amendment was made in Rule 36, Section IV, only 5 pieces of
              information can be advertised on the internet i.e. (1) name of the
              firm, (2) address, telephone numbers and email id, (3) (a)
              enrollment number, (b) date of enrollment, (c) name of State Bar
              Council where originally enrolled, (d) name of the State Bar
              Council on whose roll name stands currently and (e) name of the
              Bar Association of which the advocate is a member, (4)
              professional qualifications and academic qualifications and (5)
              areas of practice.&quot;
              <br /> According to the newspaper &apos;Economic Times&apos;,
              &quot;Under the amended rule, advocates can mention in their
              chosen websites, their names, telephone numbers, e-mail ID,
              professional qualification and areas of specialisation&quot;.
              <br /> It is interesting that such a vaguely worded statement was
              filed by the bar council in an affidavit, and the hearing of the
              case was postponed indefinitely. I think that this means that
              lawyers can put up banner advertisements on any website showing
              the permitted information. This is in fact being done on many
              websites today, including on google, and on a popular web
              directory which has hired Amitabh Bachchan to appear in its
              advertisements.
              <br /> The Bar Council of India states in the rules as laid down
              in its code of ethics in the section called &quot;An
              Advocate&apos;s duty towards Colleagues&quot; that &quot; An
              Advocate shall not solicit work or advertise, except through a
              medium maintained by the Bar Council of India, either directly or
              indirectly, whether by circulars, advertisements, touts, personal
              communications, interviews not warranted by personal relations,
              furnishing or inspiring newspaper comments or producing his/her
              photographs to be published in connection with cases in which
              he/she has been engaged or concerned. His/her sign-board or
              name-plate should be of a reasonable size. The sign-board or
              name-plate or stationery should not indicate that he/she is or has
              been a President or Member of a Bar Council or of any Association
              or that he/she has been associated with any person or organisation
              or with any particular cause or matter or that he/she specialises
              in any particular type of work or that he/she has been a Judge or
              an Advocate General.&quot;
              <br /> Here it is clarified by the Bar Council that,
              &quot;Soliciting work or &apos;advertise&apos; as used in this
              clause of the Code would not mean and include setting up of a
              web-site by an advocate or a law firm giving only basic
              information about the names and number of lawyers in a law firm,
              the contact details and areas of practice.&quot;
              <br /> If you are a young lawyer reading this, you may feel upset
              about this and say &quot;Tough luck but rules are rules&quot;. If
              this writer happens to be somewhere around you he would probably
              say &quot;Really? What rules?&quot; Let me try and list down the
              number of ways in which I can prove that this rule is totally
              misconceived, impracticable, and indeed is being violated even as
              you read these words and try to get a grip on the spirit behind
              these words.1) Are you telling me that if a lawyer becomes a law
              minister and does not stop practicing law, knowing that he is
              getting newspaper comments and headlines about him and his acts
              every day, this is ethical, and does not violate his duty towards
              his colleagues? Are you saying that you can call such behaviour
              ethical and call a &apos;lesser&apos; lawyer&apos;s advertisement
              on the internet unethical?
              <br /> 1a) Replace &apos;law minister&apos; with &apos;additional
              solicitor general&apos;, &apos;solicitor general&apos;,
              &apos;science and technology minister&apos;, &apos;governor&apos;,
              &apos;leader of the opposition&apos;, &apos;Rajya Sabha
              member&apos;, &apos;chief minister&apos;, &apos;home
              minister&apos;, &apos;finance minister&apos;, and any other title
              you can think of which has adorned a lawyer who went on to not
              quit law practice. Then repeat the question which has been asked
              at the end of point no 1 above.
              <br /> 1b) Does the BCI really feel that if a person does not tell
              people that he or she has been a judge or an advocate-general
              people will not come to know this fact? What does it feel about
              the Supreme Court putting up a list of lawyers on its website and
              stating loudly and clearly that these people are senior advocates,
              and that such and such senior advocate is a retired judge, a
              retired chief justice, or a retired advocate general? Will such
              information printed on a visiting card amount to more undue
              publicity than if it is published on the Supreme Court website,
              (as it has indeed been)?
              <br /> 2) A firm of lawyers describes itself on a website owned or
              at least operated by it as the oldest law firm in India and goes
              on to state that it &quot;boasts of an unparalleled legal
              tradition of being the legal advisor for the East India
              Company&quot; inter alia, and then goes on to list its
              achievements –tangible and intangible/unverifiable– on its home
              page (viewed on 4th October 2013). (interestingly this firm was
              founded in 1896 according to its own website, and the East India
              Company was dissolved in 1874 according to the wikipedia page
              which pertains to that company). Is this self-publicising
              behaviour not against the word and spirit of the code of ethics of
              the bar council? If such behaviour can go unnoticed or unpunished
              then why are young lawyers afraid of advertising on the internet?
              <br /> 2a) Other firms are doing similar things. For example,
              there is one firm called x and y. It claims on its website (viewed
              on 4th October 2013) that &quot;The members of the Firm offer its
              clientele high quality expertise derived from immense
              transactional experience&quot;. Is this not self-praise? Is this
              not an attempt at advertisement? (Let us assume for a moment here
              that not all people are aware of the fact that self-praise is no
              recommendation.)
              <br /> 3) Let us assume that one company makes a website which is
              totally according to BCI rules. You can look at the website of a
              company called Trilegal. I think that this website is a clear
              example of a website which does not even reach the envelope of the
              BCI rules, leave alone push it. Let us assume that there are other
              such sites. Now what is there in the BCI rules to stop such a
              website from spending a crore rupees on search engine optimisation
              and reaching the first page of Google&apos;s results? How can the
              BCI stop this when there is no agreed definition of what is and
              what is not search engine optimisation? How can you monitor or
              detect it even if you can define it?
              <br /> 3a) What about if some lawyer sets up a facebook page, and
              provides only his name, phone number, educational qualifications,
              years of experience, and area of practice on it. Now he goes on
              and spends a crore rupees on a facebook ad campaign to get a
              couple of million likes. Now he has a captive audience of about 3
              to 4 lakh persons. How can the BCI stop this? Is this stoppable?
              <br /> 3b) What about those lawyers who advertise on google? How
              about if some lawyer does not put ads/links/ads-cum-links to his
              website on google but puts them on thousands of other websites?
              This can be done very easily today. How will you monitor the whole
              internet for such ads?
              <br /> 3c) How about if somebody sets up a website which is for
              the general public, and appears to be real and useful on the face
              of it, but is actually a vehicle for an individual practice? There
              are such sites. I sent a protest to a website called 498a.org
              about how unknown people were cutting and pasting my work from my
              website to their website without my permission. I sent this
              comment using their contact us form. In reply I got a thinly
              disguised advertisement for a particular firm of lawyers and a
              link to their website.
              <br /> 4) What about if some lawyer has a friend who becomes an
              editor in a weekly supplement in a national newspaper? How can you
              prove that the weekly advice column which he has been granted by
              the editors of this paper has not been &apos;inspired&apos; by
              him? How do you stop such behaviour?
              <br /> 5) What do you do if there is an internationally famous
              rape case? Famous to such an extent that the local bar association
              passes a resolution prohibiting any of its members from accepting
              the brief of the accused men (for reasons best known to itself).
              Now comes a man who turns up in court having practically grabbed a
              brief which others are bound not to accept by the above
              resolution. Can anybody smell any collusion or illegality here?
              What do you call the resultant widespread newspaper comments?
              Inspired comments? Natural publicity?
              <br /> 6) Is not the BCI instruction to lawyers to not put any
              material on their website other than their names and address in
              direct conflict with its instruction to lawyers to provide free
              advice to needy persons?
              <br /> 7) What about those men and women who provide advice on
              forums on the internet? Do you call these &quot;interviews not
              warranted by personal relations&quot;? Or do you call this free
              legal advice to needy persons? How do you expect the lawyers
              amongst these persons to expect that their advice will be taken
              seriously if they do not provide their name and contact details?
              <br /> 8) What can a lawyer do if some competitor puts up ads
              purportedly on his behalf and then complains to the BCI? This is
              very feasible today, what with proxy IP addresses and extreme
              levels of professional rivalry. How will the BCI ensure that it is
              punishing only those who are themselves guilty of advertising for
              themselves only?
              <br /> 9) Even criminals who get convicted are known to complete
              the study of law in jail and then practice law. Does it make sense
              in the light of this fact to punish a lawyers by disenfranchising
              him for mere advertisement?
              <br /> 10) In fact even the phrase &quot;interviews not warranted
              by personal relations&quot; is a hangover from the British Raj.
              This phrase is encountered by other professionals like architects
              and chartered accountants also. It is a condition which could only
              have been dreamt up by members of the ruling class in a class
              ridden society, which is what the United Kingdom was and continues
              to be. India is pretty much the same due to such restrictions
              sanctioned by law. This flies in the face of Article 21 of the
              Constitution and needs to be scrapped urgently.

              <br /> A common phenomenon during 498a/DV litigation is that the
              wife leaves her matrimonial home and starts to live in some other
              place, thus denying her husband of his conjugal rights. Some
              lawyers will tell you that you should apply for RCR (Restitution
              of Conjugal Rights), also called Section 9 of Hindu Marriage Act.
              These lawyers are only trying to entangle you in a fruitless
              battle which will enrich them at the cost of ruining your life.
              Avoid such lawyers like the plague. Why this writer thinks so, is
              explained as follows.
              <br /> A petition for Restitution of Conjugal Rights is a petition
              to order the wife to come back to you. This is done supposedly to
              allow the spouse who wants to save the marriage to save it. Why
              the lawmakers included this provision in the law on marriage and
              divorce in India is a mystery –considering the fact that they knew
              perfectly well that you cannot force an unwilling spouse to
              cohabit with the willing spouse, even if they are in the same bed.
              <br /> Further, the slow speed of Indian courts ensures that the
              marriage is long dead before the aggrieved party is finally able
              to see his or her effort through to the conclusive stage in the
              court system. This will occupy many years of your life and lead to
              the wastage of lakhs of rupees, and in the end, even if you win
              it, even the Chief Justice of India or the Full Court of the
              Supreme Court cannot enforce it. Nobody can force your wife to
              come back to you, even if there is a court order from the highest
              court.
              <br /> Your unscrupulous lawyer may say that the RCR petition
              insulates you from 498a. This is utter hogwash. An RCR petition
              does not protect you from 498a in any way whatsoever. Remember, it
              is you who is asking your wife to come back, and she is refusing
              to come back. She can easily claim that this is due to dowry
              cruelty by you and your family –and indeed, this is what is
              invariably done by such wives. Ask yourself, if you force your
              wife with the aid of a family court to tell why she has left you,
              and if she is angry at you, then what other route remains for her
              than to accuse you of harassing or torturing her?
              <br /> RCR is a horrible, horrible mistake for the criminal side
              of your battle too. It means in effect that you are declaring that
              you have forgiven all the cruelties of your wife, and that you do
              not mind that she has left you; denied you sex and love; filed a
              DV case against you and your parents; filed 498a against you and
              your parents; and all other similar actions taken by her. You lose
              your right to file divorce on the grounds of cruelty the moment
              you file RCR. You practically lose your right to file for divorce
              on any grounds whatsoever for months if not years after your RCR
              has been decided upon by the highest court.
              <br /> Further, you have to fight your RCR until the highest
              court, and then you have to fight again from the lowest to the
              highest court to get the decree enforced. Even at the end of that,
              it is not enforceable at all.
              <br /> There is another provision in the HMA that once one party
              succeeds in getting a positive decree as a result of his/her RCR
              petition, the parties have to resume cohabitation within a period
              of one year, failing which, either party can get a divorce decree.
              This provision renders the whole RCR concept meaningless, because
              the party which wants a divorce can lead the other party up the
              garden path by allowing them to win the RCR decree in as short a
              time period as possible, and then using the same against them.
              This can be done by not contesting the RCR petition; and,
              thereafter, not resuming cohabitation within the succeeding year.
              This eventually results in a divorce decree at the end of that
              period, and the deserting party gets what they want.
              <br /> The above passage also explains why the notion that an RCR
              can dull your wife&apos;s divorce petition is foolish. She gets
              two pathways to divorce in this case, not just one.
              <br /> Another funny thing which reveals the lopsided
              interpretation of the law by the judiciary in our country is that
              the wife can file an RCR and a 498a at the same time. The courts
              do not interpret her RCR in this situation to mean that she has
              condoned the putative cruelty of the husband. They permit the 498a
              to be admitted, and allow the husband to suffer the illogical
              legal atrocity of a woman trying to send him to jail and to bring
              him to her bedroom at the same time.
              <br /> An RCR petition cannot reduce your maintenance expenditure
              either, as your wife has more than one pathway to get maintenance
              from you. India is the only country in the world where the wife
              has at least four legal provisions enabling her to ask for
              maintenance, and it is impossible to stop all four attacks if she
              is hell-bent on harassing you. Further, you must note that due to
              section 24 of HMA she can claim money from you to fight the case
              against you. And although you can file the RCR case in your city,
              the record so far overwhelmingly supports the probability that the
              legal battle will have to be fought in her city

              <br /> It is fairly common for highly educated men or men with
              technical qualifications or computer engineers aka techies and
              their families to get trapped in 498a cases. Many such men go
              abroad to seek their fortune. They –just like their brethren in
              India– epitomise the intelligent and educated man who wishes to
              rise in life through hard work and perseverance in his chosen
              field; the man who has no room in his life for lying or stealing
              to make money. It is therefore ironical –and very distressing for
              any justice loving person– that such men and their parents are
              accused of trying to get rich quick through the dowry route by the
              kind of women whose main common aim at the time of choosing such
              men is to get a comfortable life without hard work.
              <br /> The usual pattern in NRI and PIO marriages is for the woman
              –be she India based or foreign based– to come to India on some
              harmless pretext, or after creating a scene as soon as she
              realises that this man is not going to be her puppet. When she
              reaches India, she approaches any unscrupulous lawyer and gets a
              dowry complaint drafted with a mixture of truths, half-truths,
              misrepresentations, and outright lies. She makes accusations of
              dowry torture against her husband, pertaining to the short period
              when they were together in India. She also adds plenty of masala
              about the time spent abroad.
              <br /> There is also a particularly vicious kind of wife, who
              feels great pleasure in embellishing the vanilla dowry charges
              with other, wilder accusations. This may also be seen as an
              evolving trend in the 498a industry (read the note below about the
              Prince Tuli case). Such a woman may choose a few allegations out
              of assault, criminal intimidation, causing hurt, unnatural sex,
              bigamy, cheating, rape, attempted murder, outraging of modesty and
              domestic violence.
              <br /> The illogicality of her accusations does not concern her.
              Sadly, society takes a very lenient view of women making
              outlandish accusations against the men in their lives. Very
              commonly it is mentioned in court judgements in India that the
              charges were dismissed because the judge discovered that the wife
              made the accusations in a fit of rage. Interestingly, men are
              quite often given the death penalty for crimes committed in anger.
              Similarly placed women usually get away scot-free despite the fact
              that making baseless accusations is a serious crime.
              <br /> Then she approaches the local police and files the
              complaint.
              <br /> The police write to the NRI husband&apos;s parents in
              India. When the NRI husband learns about the complaint, he feels
              amazed and shocked at the outright lies, and he starts suffering
              from various fears and anxieties related to his job, his parents,
              his eligibility to continue travelling freely between countries,
              and police procedures. Some of the major fears concern being
              declared a proclaimed offender; a red corner notice being issued
              by interpol against the husband; being extradited; being able to
              get bail and to join work in his country of usual residence. Here
              this writer tries to explore some of these questions –a
              dissertation which is doomed to be superficial due to restrictions
              of length to maintain readability. These questions are, in
              reality, legal themes requiring extensive treatment which can and
              does span several tomes.The short answer is no. If you are a
              citizen of the country where you are living, then your government
              has the power to extradite you only in cases where you have
              committed a crime which is recognised by both countries as a
              crime. No country other than India considers dowry harassment a
              crime. A variation to this rule is found in certain countries
              which never extradite their own citizens, regardless of the
              charges against them. This of course does not take into account
              situations where the country which wants the accused starts
              bombing the country which is sheltering him in his capacity as its
              citizen.
              <br /> If the government of India wishes to extradite you from
              your country for other crimes mentioned in the FIR, then they have
              to follow a legal procedure in which the local national government
              has to prove to the local courts that the charges against you are
              prima facie true. It is a major diplomatic step for the Government
              of India to mobilise the engagement of lawyers in another country
              to plead before the local courts essentially on behalf of our
              sovereign state.
              <br /> Further, if the result of the court proceedings is negative
              for the Government of India, then deterioration in diplomatic
              relations is pretty much inevitable, because our country suffers
              tremendous loss of face in such a situation. Witness the
              deterioration in India-Denmark entente due to the rejection of the
              Danish government petition in the Purulia arms drop accused Kim
              Davy extradition trial.
              <br /> Such a risky endeavour will not be undertaken just to bring
              a man accused of certain marital crimes by his wife, to India. Not
              even if she accuses him of unnatural sex. Unless there is a media
              uproar here subsequent to the unnatural sex allegations. Then all
              bets are off. But you can count on a long long stay in that
              country before they are forced to send you back, because your free
              legal aid lawyers will raise at least ten legal points pertaining
              to Indian, local, and international law, which the government of
              that country will not be able to counter easily.
              <br /> (A note on allegations of unnatural sex against husband by
              wife: This is a very interesting thing which this writer noted in
              the news recently. A former miss world accused her husband (Prince
              Tuli) of unnatural sex. The husband is a frequent world traveller,
              and has a home in at least one other country apart from India. The
              nature of the allegation is worth examining in a little detail.
              The allegation pertains to a crime which is covered under a
              different section of the IPC than rape. Since marital rape is not
              a crime in India, the Government of India will not extradite any
              man accused of that crime.
              <br /> However, an IPC section which covers what is commonly
              considered to be a crime in India even if committed by a husband
              against his wife takes care of a number of things. Needless to
              mention, sexual assault of any variety is considered to be a crime
              in many countries even if committed by a husband against his wife,
              and hence extraditable. The complainant wife may be counting on a
              media scandal, and may have decided to cover the possibility of
              her husband going offshore to avoid or to prolong proceedings. She
              may have been advised that the man will be extradited in such a
              situation, since it is a crime in India as well as in a number of
              other countries. It is possible that such allegations against
              husbands may become more common in the future. This allegation, if
              made against a man resident in India, may be being used as a ruse
              to take advantage of the anonymity guaranteed by law to sexual
              assault complainants. The bride will be doing this with a view to
              avoid social ostracism which will be inevitable consequent to
              publicised dowry allegations.)

              <br /> Top of Page
              <br /> If you are a foreign citizen living in a country which is
              not your own country (i.e. a third country) OR planning to arrive
              in such a country, then that government has the right to extradite
              you to the country which got the red corner notice issued, but
              normally will not start extradition proceedings unless there is a
              red corner notice duly issued by interpol in your name. A red
              corner notice is a guarantee to instant global notoriety or fame,
              and rest assured that if the Government of India manages to get
              one issued for your arrest, then your name will be taken in the
              same breath as Hafiz Saeed, Ottavio Quattrochi, and Julian
              Assange.
              <br /> Letters Rogatory in Marital Disputes
              <br /> Top of Page
              <br /> A letter rogatory may be organised by your wife against you
              if she is extremely influential within India, and has made
              allegations pertaining to her stay with you in your country of
              residence. This sort of letter is a formal request or a set of
              requests made by India to that country to prosecute you or to take
              your deposition or to gather material / evidence against you. Each
              of these requests made under any particular LR have to be in
              consonance with Indian procedure, Indian law, commonly accepted
              international procedure OR procedure as established over time
              between the two countries, international law, the law of that
              country, and the procedure of that country in order to cause legal
              action against you. On top of all this there is the interference
              and procedural delays of the two foreign ministries of the
              countries involved. Plus there are all the levels of courts where
              you can appeal in that country, and all the levels of courts where
              the Indian government can appeal against your wife&apos;s petition
              in India, if it so desires, and if it is not a co-petitioner with
              her. An attempt by her to organise an LR in order to hurt you is
              pretty much a futile exercise except if she wishes to generate
              publicity against you. Even in that situation she faces the risk
              of her being laughed out of court, and the subsequent media
              humiliation.
              <br /> Extradition of Indian Citizens to India in Marital Disputes
              <br /> Top of Page
              <br /> If you are a citizen of India, then the government of India
              cannot extradite you in situations where it cannot extradite
              non-citizens. However, it can cancel or revoke your passport and
              get you sent back home if you are in a country where the
              government can exert diplomatic pressure. India has the second
              largest diplomatic corps in the world, and many of them are very
              professional, with a reputation that matches their skills.
              However, the Gulshan Kumar / Nadeem Saifi case shows that even
              Indian citizens may be able to successfully resist extradition.
              Readers might also be aware that Lalit Modi and Sangeeta Richard
              (the maid in the Khobragade case in America) have both had their
              passports cancelled by the Government of India in separate bids to
              extradite them. Both the actions resulted in varying amounts of
              bad publicity, with the latter case in particular boomeranging in
              an exceptionally strong manner on the Khobragade woman –who still
              cannot make out what hit her, by all accounts.
              <br /> Proclaimed Offender Status
              <br /> Top of Page
              <br /> If an accused person does not come to India, or does not
              surrender before the court or the police even after getting
              repeated summonses or warnings to do so, then a competent court
              may declare such a person a proclaimed offender. Getting
              proclaimed offender status is a surefire guarantee that such a
              person will find it impossible to get bail after being caught and
              arrested if he ever decides to return to India. A red corner
              notice means that the P.O. is internationally recognised as such.
              <br /> Deportation of Proclaimed Offenders to India
              <br /> Top of Page
              <br /> Another thing that has happened sometimes is that a person
              has been deported to India by the local authorities on some
              pretext, without waiting for the local judiciary to scrutinise the
              extradition request. This writer is not aware of the different
              ways in which local citizens, citizens of India, and foreigners
              have been historically treated or classified for the purpose of
              differential treatment in such situations, although logic and
              international law dictates that a foreigner should be deported to
              his own country, not to India.
              <br /> Lookout Notice/Alert
              <br /> Top of Page
              <br /> Lookout notices or alerts are issued to airports and
              various points of entry at international borders to arrest a
              particular person who may or may not be a proclaimed offender upon
              an attempt to enter or to leave India. Or to not permit a
              particular person to enter or to leave India. Husbands accused in
              498a cases do not normally need to worry about this sort of
              treatment, unless they refused to come to India for a long time
              after being accused.
              <br /> Do not get confused if you see the acronym LOC in the
              context of lookout notices. It means Look-Out Circular –a circular
              being the same thing as an internal notice or a memo. This
              language is used due to the limited circulation of some such
              notices, which is to say that the notice may not be publicised to
              the general public in certain cases and may be viewable only by a
              limited audience.
              <br /> In Conclusion
              <br /> Top of Page
              <br /> Further note that the number of accused persons extradited
              from the rest of the world to India in the last 10 years
              –including foreign citizens as well as Indians– is not more than
              40 to 50.

              There is a provision in law which is called &quot;dowry
              death&quot;. This provision is described in and as IPC Section
              304b. The text of this section is as follows­–
              <br />
              1) Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily
              injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances within
              seven years of her marriage and it is shown that soon before her
              death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or
              any relative of her husband for, or in connection with, any demand
              for dowry, such death shall be called&quot; dowry death&quot;, and
              such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death.
              Explanation.- For the purposes of this sub- section,&quot;
              dowry&quot; shall have the same meaning as in section 2 of the
              Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 (28 of 1961 ).
              <br />
              2) Whoever commits dowry death shall be punished with imprisonment
              for a term which shall not be less than seven years but which may
              extend to imprisonment for life.]&quot;
              <br />
              This provision was enacted at the same time as the insertion of a
              new section numbered 113b to the Indian Evidence Act. This section
              states the following–
              <br />
              “When the question is whether a person has committed the dowry
              death of a woman and it is shown that soon before her death such
              woman had been subjected by such person to cruelty or harassment
              for or in connection with any demand for dowry, the court shall
              presume that such person had caused the dowry death.”
              <br />
              The first thing which any literate person notices in these
              enactments is the phrase &quot;soon before&quot;. This shows in
              very clear terms the degree of shoddiness with which laws in India
              are drafted. &quot;A little before&quot; or &quot;just
              before&quot; or &quot;some time before&quot; or &quot;shortly
              before&quot; or &quot;before did not occur to the person who wrote
              this law (leave alone &quot;upto six months before&quot; or
              &quot;upto a year before&quot;). He/she insisted on using the
              expression &quot;soon before&quot;.
              <br />
              Things can happen soon after something, but how something can
              happen soon before something is a mystery to this writer, as I am
              sure it is to all English speaking people who do not own a time
              machine.
              <br />
              This also reveals a fact which is obvious to those who see
              lawmaking in India with a critical eye. Parliament is just a
              rubber stamp for the leader of the ruling party. Whatever the
              leader decides is implemented. The members do not really bother to
              read the text of the bills which are brought in for passing by the
              national legislature.
              <br />
              This is not surprising. Laws are made in English. Members of
              Parliament are ten times more comfortable with their own languages
              than with English. Sixty-six years after independence the number
              of people who have a good grasp of the language which is used to
              govern our country is microscopically small in proportion to the
              total number of literate people in the country –and negligible in
              proportion to the total population of our country.
              <br />
              But is this enough justification? Were there no men or women in
              Parliament who knew the English language well enough to remove an
              incorrect phrase from the wording of the law when the law was
              being examined? Have there been no influential persons in the 27
              years since the enactment of this section of the Indian Penal Code
              who have read this section and wondered how the greatest democracy
              in the world can tolerate incomprehensible language in its
              criminal law? This is dangerous. For the word of the law is the
              law, unless it runs into mavericks like Katju and Sinha who
              famously said about another law that it is unhappily worded, and
              reiterated the well settled jurisprudential convention that absurd
              interpretations of law cannot be countenanced. I refer to the
              Batra versus Batra verdict in a case involving a significant
              provision of the PWDVA 2005.
              <br />
              (Section 113b was in fact blunted by a bench of Arijit Pasayat and
              Asok Kumar Ganguly in 2009. But the phenomenon which afflicts the
              legislature –and is being discussed in this article– is
              persistent.)
              <br />
              And this begs another, more important question. If the tall men
              and women who enacted this law did not notice a linguistic error
              in the law, can we not be absolutely certain that they did not
              bother to delve into the reasoning behind the law and the possible
              damage that it could cause in the future (and indeed would)?
              <br />
              The other interesting and objectionable phrase here is
              &quot;Whoever commits dowry death&quot;. How can somebody commit
              death? I know you can kill someone, and commit murder (or culpable
              homicide, to stretch the rubric) thereby, but really, committing
              death? This uncomfortable language springs from the insolent
              dictated assumption that &quot;the husband or relative shall be
              deemed to have caused her death&quot;. Whichever way you try to
              wrap your head around this statement, the meaning that can be
              extracted here is always that of a homicide accusation.
              <br />
              The honest but stupid accuser here would say that the husband is
              guilty of murder. The cunning accuser will say that the husband is
              &quot;responsible for the wife&apos;s death&quot;, because he
              knows that although you can (as things stand today) legislate
              illogical &apos;logic&apos; into the Indian Penal Code or the
              Indian Evidence Act, you simply cannot equate harassment with
              murder (or even culpable murder) in so many words, without risking
              accusations of monumental stupidity. The accuser/schemer who is
              incredibly sneaky will use the expression that the husband is
              &quot;guilty of causing dowry death&quot;. This is because he
              knows that you cannot use the word murder for such an offence (for
              the reason mentioned above), AND you cannot justify life
              imprisonment just for culpable homicide. So he has invented a new
              category of offence in the class of offences which deal with
              unintentional or intentional violation of the right to life, in
              terms of a life being extinguished. This category of offence is
              not just an implausible or counter-intuitive category. It is
              purely intellectual claptrap dignified to the level of a national
              law.
              <br />
              Also relevant is the question, how can you tell someone what he
              shall or shall not assume? How can you legislate compulsory
              assumptions? Are our judges not thinking men and women? Do they
              not have consciences which will erupt if they see a man getting
              away with the systematic violation of a woman&apos;s right to
              life? On the other hand, why do you want them to remain powerless
              to do justice in the face of a law advocating presumption of
              guilt? The philosophical basis of law in a functioning democracy
              is justice for all and justice for everyone. It is not justice for
              certain classes of people, and revenge from certain classes of
              people for the past actions of other members of their class.
              <br />
              The reasons for the enactment of this law and other unjust laws
              are not difficult to deduce. Let us go back to the early 80s in
              India. The aggressively pushed growth of the television medium was
              being propelled by the desire to achieve most effectively the sole
              aim of publicising the daily routine of one person. Media barons
              were as concerned about the public as they are today. They were
              directing the editorial actions of their businesses as ruthlessly
              as they do today. Diversionary campaigns were being launched on
              the front pages of the (broader then than now) broadsheets. The
              salaries of newspaper employees were as fantastic as they are
              today. Peanuts were being paid to generate armies of you know who.
              Political gossip was being touted as hard news. The process that
              led to this helped the simians to curry favour, too.
              <br />
              To increase circulation was the sole imperative and motive, for
              this would help tremendously in bringing in the big bucks at the
              right times, before sending them out west by north-west. (Massive
              diversionary campaigns are organised by major newspapers today
              also; the Nirbhaya campaign was blown up to &apos;iconic
              proportions&apos; to quote a recently retired CJI. The aim –as far
              as this writer can make out– was to increase viewership of certain
              newspaper websites in western countries in order to get more
              advertising revenue. The result did help the country indirectly,
              but there are more genuine ways of achieving such objectives.) The
              newspapers of record were busy telling the government to stop
              paying out pensions in the interest of reducing
              &apos;wasteful&apos; revenue expenditure. This was being done to
              get talent –which might go to the public sector in the normal
              course– to agree to their terms in a more pliant fashion. It might
              be hazarded that capital expenditure was effective at some level
              close to 10 paise to the rupee, since that was the figure
              –pronounced at a later date– by the late PM who knew the workings
              better than anyone by virtue of his position.
              <br />
              Many senior editors were congratulating themselves in
              time-honoured fashion for their sensible Faustian bargains. Irani
              and Chitra Subramaniam were yet to swing into action –their cause
              for action was to arise around this time. Zombie mobs were yet to
              start making their appearance at the walls if I remember
              correctly, but the royal classes were keenly aware that placebos
              had to be given to this class regularly.

              <br />
              Hinduism is widely accepted as the oldest religion in the world.
              The proto Hindu people did not identify themselves by the title
              &apos;Hindu&apos;. They referred to themselves as the
              &apos;Arya&apos; people –a word which can be translated into
              English as &apos;Aryan&apos;. Their name for their religion was
              &apos;Dharma&apos;, which means &apos;Duty&apos;. They used this
              word because the concept of religion in a generic sense did not
              exist at that time, since theirs was the only religion in
              existence.
              <br />
              The concept of a family is older than Hinduism, older than
              civilisation, and indeed older than the species itself. Hindus
              inherited this concept from their forefathers who had not followed
              any religion, and practiced it in its purest natural form,
              permitting polygamy, monogamy and polyandry depending upon the
              location and circumstances.
              <br />
              Social structures in mythology are invariably a reflection of the
              extant social structures at the time and place of myth creation.
              As such, we can make out that polygamy, monogamy, and polyandry
              were familiar phenomena around the time when the Mahabharata and
              the Ramayana were written, though it may perhaps not be wise to
              conjecture as to how common each of these systems was just on the
              basis of this evidence. One thing, however, which can be observed
              from an analysis of this body of literature is that only men and
              women of high social standing were able to have more than one
              spouse. Monogamy was the lot of the rest of society –or its good
              fortune, call it what you will.
              <br />
              Although gods and kings would usually have more than one wife, the
              role of one of these ladies in their lives was usually recognised
              as being predominant by most observers, and their historical and
              mythical descriptions dwelled more on this consort. Rishis were
              usually shown as having only the one wife, or none at all.
              Shiv-Parvati, Vishnu-Lakshmi, Brahma-Saraswati, Indra-Shachi,
              Ram-Sita, and Vashishtha-Arundhati are all married pairs
              recognised and respected by more than a billion Hindus.
              <br />
              It was considered a worthy aim –deserving prolonged efforts– to
              meet and marry a good member of the opposite sex. Even the Lord of
              Lords Himself, Shiva is but shava (corpse) without Shakti,
              according to oft quoted sastric sources. So don&apos;t think that
              you are a lesser human being because you are missing your nightly
              dose, or are slowly withering away for this reason. The other side
              of this is that women are almost totally dependent upon men for
              providing them security. In Hindu mythology, women usually derived
              their identity from their husbands or other men. Even a powerful
              figures like Draupadi was powerful due to Lord Krishna&apos;s
              affection for her. Sita ji was also King Janak&apos;s daughter. It
              is said about Janak that Kuber himself was envious of this
              king&apos;s wealth. This is not to deprecate the tremendous force
              that Sita ji was. She was indeed the embodiment of Adi Shakti
              herself. But what can be surmised from the fact that there is
              practically no notable adult female in this body of work who is
              not married, while such men are aplenty?
              <br />
              It is instructive to read about the life of Maharishi Kardam /
              Kardama to get a glimpse into the Hindu view of marriage and the
              good that it can bring to individual persons and/or society. It
              may be stated that this story shows many facets of the Hindu view
              on life itself, and not just marriage, if marriage can indeed be
              justifiably prefixed with the word &apos;just&apos;.Kardama Rishi
              is no small figure in the Hindu pantheon. He is recognised as a
              son of the Creator, Lord Brahma himself. He is the father of Sage
              Kapil –avatar of Lord Vishnu and as the most perfect of beings
              according to Lord Krishna in the Mahabharat/Gita (&quot;Amongst
              perfect beings I am the Sage Kapila&quot;).
              <br />
              Kardama is also the father-in-law of nine great rishis, each of
              whom is recognised as a powerful and venerated figure by Hindus.
              Five of them are especially notable, namely Atri, Vashishtha,
              Bhrigu, Pulastya, and Angiras or Angira. The other four are no
              less in their penance and powers, although not mentioned as often
              in the scriptures as the other five. These are Marichi, Pulaja or
              Pulah, Kratu, and Atharva. It is interesting to note that at least
              eight of these men (this writer cannot be bothered to research the
              background of Atharva at this point in time) are sons of Brahma,
              just like their father-in-law Kardama. These rishis are amongst
              the ten sons considered to have been born from either the mind or
              various parts of the body of Brahma, whereas Kardama is the only
              one who is considered to have been born from the shadow of Brahma.
              <br />
              Rishi Kardama conducted penance on the banks of the Saraswati
              river for ten thousand years, following the advice of his father
              to propitiate Lord Vishnu in order to obtain an ideal woman. This
              shows the extent to which a Hindu man is expected to go in order
              to win a fair maiden. Indeed, the effort which a modern day man
              puts into obtaining education and reaching a satisfactory place in
              his career is substantially directed towards attracting a worthy
              woman.
              <br />
              The Lord appeared before him and asked him his desire. This is a
              concept which is engrained in the Hindu mind, and has been put
              into words by the poet,
              <br />
              &quot;Khudi ko kar buland itna ke har taqdeer se pehle
              <br />
              Khuda bande se ye poochhe bata teri raza kya hai&quot;
              <br />
              i.e. the worshipper forces God Himself to come to him and ask his
              desire.
              <br />
              Sage Kardama requested the Lord to give him a wife to
              &quot;fulfill my lustful desires&quot;. The great rishi phrases
              his desire for noble progeny in such language! This is reflective
              of the man&apos;s humbleness, and shows the self-deprecation that
              every Hindu is expected to practice, as a part of his religious
              duty to be humble. Incidentally, this writer has observed that
              people belonging to oppressed classes in his country –or coming
              from such a background– are (taught (by the government, judiciary,
              and industrialist-owned media) to be) self-deprecating to such an
              extent that their behaviour and values amount to self defeating
              personality disorder. This leads to them being oppressed
              perpetually by themselves and by narcissists, individually as well
              as as a class. This phenomenon can commonly be seen amongst
              farmers in India, and has been depicted deliberately or
              sub-consciously in popular culture by Bimal Roy and Mehboob Khan
              in their movie tours de force, Do Bigha Zameen, and Mother India.
              <br />
              he lord told Rishi Kardama that Swayambhuv Manu and Shatrupa will
              come to him themselves and offer their daughter Devahuti, who was
              renowned for her beauty, and upon seeing whom from his aircraft, a
              gandharva got hypnotised and fell to the ground. Pleased to hear
              such words from the Lord, Kardama prostrated himself at His feet.
              <br />
              Swayambhuva Manu and Shatrupa were both children of Brahma, but it
              would perhaps not be correct to call them brother and sister since
              they were born out of two Brahmas (google it(I am talking to you,
              not to myself))(should I tell them (now (nice beer (Saturday and
              Tuborg, great combination(!)) I am talking to myself) that it was
              actually two halves of Brahma?). Well actually, they were born out
              of two halves of Brahma. They were created after the Lord felt
              that his ten sons were perhaps not upto the job of populating the
              universe, and he hit upon the idea of sexual propagation of
              species.
              <br />
              Narad Muni –another son of Brahma and a great devotee of Lord
              Vishnu who was born as Lord Hanuman in the Treta Yuga– had already
              done the work of a mediator by going to Swayambhuv Manu&apos;s
              palace and meeting Devahuti. Narad&apos;s stellar description of
              Kardama&apos;s coruscant personality had captured Devahuti&apos;s
              imagination, and the chaste princess was well and truly
              lovestruck.
              <br />
              Narad&apos;s role as a mediator here shows the importance of the
              mediator in traditional Indian marriages. A mediator could become
              a mediator even without meeting any of the parties –and this still
              happens in many parts of Indian society. They just need to be a
              person of good social standing who is directly or indirectly known
              to both parties. Alternatively, there can be two mediators who are
              known to each other, one from each side. In villages in northern
              India, barbers used to play the role of mediators in marriages.
              Many Indians of two generations ago will tell you that their
              marriage was fixed by a barber from their village. Even today,
              even law enforcement authorities try to talk to the mediator when
              something goes wrong in a marriage and the matter is brought to
              their notice.
              <br />
              Devahuti&apos;s status as a chaste bride who is enamoured by just
              the description of a prospective mate, and –as the perceptive
              observer will note– by the fact that the person who is being
              described is a prospective mate shows that the high value placed
              in Indian society upon virginity of a woman before marriage is not
              misplaced, if making wives fall in love with their husbands is one
              of the aims of marriage. This writer would disagree with Mario
              Puzo&apos;s (derisive?) comment about virginity being prized in
              primitive societies (Sicily episode) if he could nail the
              definition of primitive society. Let it be mentioned here that in
              the three cultures apart from India which this writer has seen
              from close quarters, bridal virginity is highly valued by certain
              sections of society.
              <br />
              Narada&apos;s visit to Swayambhuv Manu and Shatrupa shows the role
              of the parents of the prospective bride in making a decision which
              is one of the most important decisions in her life. His meeting
              with Devahuti shows the importance of getting the girl&apos;s
              consent. The girl herself is the final decision maker within her
              family, and the boy is invariably of a higher social standing. The
              girl&apos;s guardians visit the boy&apos;s home after getting her
              consent and the boy normally insists upon having the final word.
              This is very logical, because unless the woman falls in love with
              the man first, and then vice-versa, the marriage is doomed to
              fail. In earlier days, the boy used to give his consent after
              meeting the girl&apos;s guardians. Later the system changed to
              adapt to the need of the boy to see the girl once before
              consenting. Today people live-in together for a few months or
              years and then get married, but still the divorce rate is shooting
              up.
              <br />
              Swayambhuv Manu and Shatrupa approached Kardama Rishi and
              requested him to accept their daughter&apos;s hand. Kardama
              graciously agreed. The chaste Devahuti was married to him, and he
              conjured up a great aircraft which was bigger than a city, and had
              many palaces and pleasure gardens, and thousands of handmaidens
              and manservants to obey every desire of Devahuti. The handmaidens
              gave Devahuti the ancient equivalent of the full beauty treatment,
              and the newly married couple set off on their pleasure tour across
              the universe. They flew for ten thousand years, and then after
              they came back they had nine daughters.
              <br />
              This episode shows the importance of the honeymoon in ancient
              India. Newly married couples need to spend time with each other in
              order to well and truly fall in love with each other, and to
              create a strong bond between them. The appearance of children only
              after their return to Earth seems to be unusual, but what is not
              possible for the son of the Creator Himself? Perhaps he decided to
              not impregnate his wife until the time came to return.
              <br />
              Later on, Sage Kardama set off again on his penances after making
              Devahuti pregnant with the sage Kapila or Kapiladeva, an avtar of
              Lord Vishnu. Devahuti learnt the secrets of the Vedas from her
              son, and they all ascended to Vaikunth Lok ultimately.
              <br />
              This shows the importance of Sanyas Ashram in the Hindu system.
              Many of us have seen the various ashrams of a man&apos;s life
              described in a humorous fashion in the modern classic film
              Padosan.
              <br />
              It is shown in the above story that a couple can attain salvation
              if they fulfill all their household and religious duties.

              Hindu Marriage: Earliest Codification - Manu and Manu Smriti

              <br />
              Marriage systems and traditions were established in ancient India
              over an extended period of sustained imbibing and processing –and
              gradual codification– of social mores by scholars and thinkers.
              The codification may have taken hundreds of years, or it may have
              occurred relatively quickly. It may have been passed on orally
              initially –like the Vedas– or may have been rendered in written
              form ab initio. Commentaries made by many savants are available to
              this day. As is well known, the Puranas and the Upanishads are a
              major source of Hindu recorded wisdom. There is also a series of
              books known as smritis which are rich sources of Hindu tradition.
              <br />
              Two important lawgivers in these traditions were Manu and
              Yagyavalkya or Yajnavalkya. They were as important to the Aryans
              of Aryavart as Hammurabi was to the Sumerians of Mesopotamia. Manu
              was the more ancient of the two, and he propagated many ideas,
              some of which would have led to serious criminal charges being
              laid against him in modern day India. These ideas relate to the
              position of what were called the lower castes in those times.
              Today there is serious opposition to Manu&apos;s ideas from the
              traditionally oppressed classes which are now known as dalits in
              India. Interestingly, many leaders of the dalits continue to refer
              to the former so called upper castes as upper castes. These
              leaders include a lady who has been and continues to be a major
              state level and national leader.
              <br />
              Yagyavalkya was the more evolved of the two (himself and Manu),
              but he too was not entirely sinless as far as his attitude towards
              the so-called lower castes was concerned. More about him later.
              For now we will concentrate on Manu, and his Manu Smriti.
              <br />
              (It is also interesting to note that though Manu has been disowned
              and discarded by the powers that be in our democracy, his smriti
              continues to provide a large portion of the bases and
              philosophical grounds for various provisions in marriage law for
              Hindus. This may be considered distressing in view of the fact
              that Manu has been repudiated precisely because of his smriti.
              Social mores have also progressed, and the homogeneity that
              existed in those times has been atomised and coloured in lakhs or
              crores of hues seen over lakhs or crores of pixellated and
              amorphous social formations.)
              <br />
              Manu Smriti is vast in its scope. It purports to explain all of
              the cosmos, the nature of human beings, and the path that men and
              women should follow, amongst a host of other things. It goes from
              the beginning of creation to its end. It proclaims the law on
              behaviour and conduct of all the four Varnas, the process of
              Creation, the various sacraments (sanskaars) of a Hindu from
              conception to birth, life, death, and beyond. It also lays down
              the rules to be followed by a student vis-à-vis his studies and
              his guru –the equivalent of a modern university&apos;s ordinances
              or calendar, and more.
              <br />
              It declares the norms for relationships between men and women and
              men and men; the law governing bachelors, married men, retired
              persons, and renunciation; the law regarding rightful livelihood;
              the law on marriage; the ways to obtain salvation (moksha). It
              describes the provenance of intermediate or mixed castes; the way
              of administering justice; the laws of various lands; the law about
              gambling; the ways to remove obstacles and villains; and many many
              other things.
              <br />
              Manu talks about sruti and smriti. Sruti is the knowledge which
              has been received by mankind via revelation, while smriti is the
              aggregate of the traditions that keep Hindu culture alive, united,
              and coherent in his view. Examples of the first are the Gita and
              the vedas. Interestingly he mentions that two srutis can state
              conflicting views and can both be valid simultaneously.Manu was
              one of the earliest to mention clearly that the stage of life
              after the brahmcharya ashram is the grihastha ashram. The former
              is the first part of life, during which a young man goes from
              being born to being a student and learning about the scriptures.
              This ashram is entered into by all men of the twice born castes,
              i.e. Brahmans, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas. All of these castes are
              eligible –and required– to study the vedas, but they are not all
              eligible to teach the same. Only a Brahman can be permitted to
              teach this revealed knowledge to his own and other castes.
              <br />
              The minimum requirement for a Hindu man to get married is to find
              a chaste woman from his own caste, or an equal caste –virginity
              being as important as caste. Manu further says that only a woman
              with auspicious marks on her body may be married. This leads to
              the inevitable suspicion that Manu did not want Hindu men to marry
              disabled women. Manu goes on to mention several categories of
              women who cannot be married. These include epileptic women.
              Amazingly, instead of removing this oppressive condition from
              statute, the framers of the Hindu Marriage Act made it possible to
              get marriages annulled if either the man or the woman in that
              marriage was an epileptic. This is too good! Don&apos;t eliminate
              the oppression of women. Just oppress men equally and call it
              even. This condition was removed from the relevant law near the
              end of the twentieth century.
              <br />A few other categories of women who cannot be married are
              sapindas of the Hindu man on his mother&apos;s side, or women who
              are related to him on his father&apos;s side of the family; those
              who suffer certain specified diseases; women named after
              constellations (so all men who get married to women named Swati
              are breaking Manu&apos;s Law!); or women who have fear-inducing
              names (no Kalis, Kalindikas, Chamundas, Kaal Bhairavis or perhaps
              even Durgas). He disallows women who belong to families which do
              not follow vedic rituals; women who are named after rivers (no
              Gomatis, Narmadas or Mandakinis); women who are named after trees
              (no Ambikas or Kadambaris); women who are named after birds (no
              Sarikas); and women who have no brothers. Recently a census
              officer announced that the present gender ratio in Delhi is the
              highest in recorded history, i.e. in the last 111 years.
              Manu&apos;s proscription explains why the sex ratio was low before
              the invention of Amnioscentesis. Manu also forbids marrying a
              woman whose father is not known, in order to avoid the possibility
              of committing incest.
              <br />
              Manu permits second marriages. He is in fact much more liberal in
              terms of caste requirements in the case of second marriages than
              in first marriages. He says that any man can marry any woman of
              his own caste or a lower caste should he decide to take a second
              wife. This in part shows the concept of Anuloma and Pratiloma; the
              first being a marriage between a man of a higher caste and a woman
              of a lower caste. Such a marriage is permitted. The other kind
              ­–Pratiloma–­ is not. However, this comes with the proviso that
              any Brahman who takes a Shudra wife as his second wife will go to
              hell after death if he sleeps with her. If he happens to procreate
              with her, he will lose his caste and acquire her caste. Should
              this make us deduce that losing caste was worse than going to hell
              for Manu?
              <br />
              Anuloma and Pratiloma today can be seen all over the world. The
              only difference is that instead of caste, the status of the groom
              is determined by his financial standing vis-à-vis the bride. The
              first one is called hypergamy in our times, and is also called
              &quot;marrying up&quot; in common parlance. It is commonly
              observed that women marry men who are above them in financial
              status, and hypergamy is the aim of most women in life. The modern
              equivalent of Pratiloma is called hypogamy (or emotional
              foolishness when a woman does it, according to most &apos;well
              wishers&apos;).
              <br />
              One quasi-famous movie actress –who is the daughter of a popular
              actor of the 1980s and 1990s who refuses to grow fat or to start
              looking his age– mentioned in an interview that any prospective
              suitor would have to be &quot;more successful, more famous, better
              looking(...?), and richer than me&quot;. A beauty queen turned
              actress from the 1990s was quoted as saying that she would only
              marry a man who could afford her. There is some justification in
              the view that such women are destined to live alone for the rest
              of their lives. When a successful movie star married her boyfriend
              and started demanding that she would only act in movies if the
              boyfriend was cast opposite her, she quickly lost currency. She is
              apparently still happily married to the man, and they have no
              financial problems.
              <br />
              Manu also mentions eight types of weddings. These are –in
              decreasing order of merit–
              <br />
              1) Brahma Vivaha (wedding rites followed by Lord Brahma and by
              Brahmans) – In this way of conducting weddings, the father of the
              bride gives her away to a knower of the Vedas –invited by the
              father himself– after decorating the bride with jewellery and fine
              clothes.
              <br />
              This type of wedding finds resonance in the modern system where
              the father of an eligible girl looks for a highly educated groom.
              Little do such parents realise that they are imitating other
              parents, who lived in ancient times. The modern modification to
              this system is that the desirable groom must also be financially
              successful. This renders the analogy meaningless, as knowers of
              the Vedas in ancient times were almost invariably poor.
              <br />
              2) Daiva Vivah (rites followed by the gods) – In this type of
              wedding the father of the bride gives her away to the officiating
              priest at a yagya or a yajna (a sacrifice), while the yajna is
              ongoing.
              <br />
              Such betrothals are extinct today as far as this writer knows.
              <br />
              3) Arsha Vivaha (the rite of the rishis) – In this type of Hindu
              wedding, the father of the bride gives her away to a groom who
              gifts to the father one cow and one bull or two cows and two
              bulls.
              <br />
              This happens in modern times. But the Asura Vivaah and the third
              type in this natural progression –which finds no mention in
              Manu&apos;s work– is more common now. (Guess what the third type
              is?)
              <br />
              4) Pragapatya Vivaah (wedding ala prajapatis)– In this type of
              wedding, the father of the bride gives her away to any groom after
              blessing the couple, and honouring the groom.
              <br />
              This is also fairly common today, and a combination of this and
              part of the first type appears to be prevalent in ritualised
              weddings in India.
              <br />
              5) Asura Vivaah (the system of the asuras)– In this type of Hindu
              wedding, the groom voluntarily gives as much money and gifts as he
              can afford to give to the bride and to her family in order to get
              her consent for marriage.
              <br />
              6) Gaandharva Vivah (wedding in the way followed by gandharvas)–
              In this type of wedding, a man seduces a woman and takes her as
              his wife by virtue of the seduction, without any rites whatsoever.
              <br />
              This is simply another name for the eternal dance between men and
              women.
              <br />
              7) Rakshasa Vivaah (the system of the rakshasas)– In this type of
              &apos;wedding&apos;, the killer or assaulter of a woman&apos;s
              family members or father takes her as his wife by kidnapping and
              raping her. This may have the added highlight of the man breaking
              into the woman&apos;s house.
              <br />
              This is called assault, kidnapping, dacoity, and rape today. Any
              man who perpetrates this stands a great chance of getting free
              government hospitality for the rest of his life. If killing is a
              part of the &apos;wedding&apos; then the government is pretty much
              guaranteed to provide a free ride to another region of the
              universe these days to the lucky groom.
              <br />
              8) Paisaka Vivah (wedding in the manner of pishaachas, or lost
              souls)– In this type of &apos;wedding&apos;, a man rapes a
              sleeping or intoxicated or imbecile woman. This is the basest of
              all methods, and is forbidden on pain of incurring grave demerit.
              <br />
              his is pure sociopathy and/or lunacy, although there is a debate
              about the &apos;intoxicated woman&apos; part of this phenomenon.
              <br />
              Manu also mentions the merit or demerit earned by entering
              marriage via each of these types of methods. He details out the
              number of generations of ancestors and descendants whose souls the
              sons born out of such marriages can save by acting virtuously. He
              adumbrates the various ways and times in which a man may approach
              his wife sexually. He talks extensively about the castes of
              children born from inter-caste marriages.
              <br />
              Manu also talks about the honour and adornments which are every
              woman&apos;s due, and declares that the family or society where
              women are not honoured will be destroyed in short order. He
              decries those forms of marriage in which the father of the bride
              accepts gifts from the groom. He makes no mention of dowry though
              he praises fathers who adorn their daughters with fine clothes and
              jewellery, as he does similarly placed husbands, brothers, and
              sons. People who have seen Hindu wedding rituals might remember
              that the father of the bride declared at the time of giving her
              away to the groom that he had dressed her up in fine clothes and
              jewellery to the best of his ability.

              Hindu Marriage: Yajnavalkya and his Enduring Smriti

              Yagyavalkya or Yajnavalkya was a rishi who was born in the Dwapar
              Yug. He was the disciple of Vaishampayana, who in turn was a
              disciple of Ved Vyasa. Yagyavalkya was also the preceptor of King
              Janak of Videha. Videha&apos;s Capital was Mithila. Sita was
              commonly known as Maithili or Vaidehi –names derived from the
              names of her father&apos;s kingdom and its Capital. Janak himself
              was also known as Videha. Sita and her father Janak predated the
              Janak who was Yajnavalkya&apos;s student by many centuries. There
              were in fact more than 50 Janaks who ruled over Videha.
              <br />
              Yagyavalkya learnt the Krishna Yajurveda from his guru. The guru
              was upset with Yagyavalkya once and told him to return all his
              knowledge, which he did. Then he decided to find a divine guru
              since he was disappointed with his previous, human, guru. He
              propitiated Lord Surya through his penances and requested him to
              give him knowledge. The Sun god gave him knowledge of those
              portions of the Yajurveda which were unknown to humans before him.
              This part of the Yajurveda is known as the Shukla Yajurveda, or
              the white Yajurveda.
              <br />
              The sage grew in fame after this episode, and with time came to be
              known as one of the greatest thinkers in the history of Hinduism.
              His works are numerous, and he is most remembered for his dialogue
              with Maitreyi (one of his two wives), his dialogue with King
              Janak, the Yajnavalkya Samhita, the Yajnavalkya Smriti, the
              Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the Yajnavalkya Upanishad, and his
              dialogue with Gargi. Incidentally Gargi and Maitreyi are well-know
              to people in Delhi, as two of Delhi University&apos;s colleges for
              women.
              <br />
              This work has far surpassed the importance of Manu Smriti and the
              other three main smritis, viz. Parashar Smriti (deemed to be
              relevant for the Kali Yug), Gautam Smriti (deemed to be relevant
              for the Treta Yug), Sankha Smriti or Sankha-Likhita Smriti
              (relevant for the Dwapar Yug). Since Manu Smriti has been deemed
              to be relevant for the Satya Yug, no Yug is left for the
              Yajnavalkya Smriti. However, most of Hindu tradition today is
              based on the Yajnavalkya Smriti. To paraphrase Rai Bahadur Srisa
              Chandra Vidyarnava from his authoritative translation, the reason
              for the prevalence of the Yajnavalkya Smriti is its superior
              organisation and structure (Vidyarnava, R.B.S.C., Yajnavalkya
              Smriti: Mitaksara and Balambhatta, 1918, Allahabad).
              <br />
              The smriti has a chapterised progression from Achara (literally
              &quot;conduct&quot;, concerning religion and religious practices
              and law) and Vyavahara (literally &quot;behaviour&quot;,
              concerning civil and criminal law) to, finally, Prayashchita
              (literally &quot;atonement&quot;, concerning sins and their
              rectification) (Katju, M., speech delivered at Gulbarga
              University, 2004, Gulbarga).
              <br />
              Much of Yajnavalkya&apos;s work is derivative. He has relied upon
              the Manu Smriti, several Puranas, and a few other smritis like the
              Narada Smriti, Vishnu Smriti, and the smritis named above. He
              repeats a lot of the things which were said by Manu in his smriti,
              but he is tentative about one of his regressive and repetitive
              recitations, viz. the prohibition of widow remarriage, as ordained
              by Manu. He reiterates the eight forms of marriage described by
              Manu and earlier sources. He permits issueless women to have
              sexual relations with men in the event of and after their
              husbands&apos; deaths. Such physical relations are permitted only
              with a brother or a cousin of the husband or a man from his clan.
              However he forbids any further sex once a child is born out of
              such relations.Yajnavalkya permits sons of second wives and of
              widows (conceived in the manner described above) to inherit the
              property of their fathers if &apos;superior&apos; sons are not
              available. He has therefore moved one step forward from Manu in
              the direction of liberal laws. This was an important point in the
              history of India as it recorded a progression in society&apos;s
              codified attitudes for the first time. This gave impetus to future
              thinkers who could now see that progress was indeed possible. This
              was especially important for &apos;Shudras&apos; and Women,
              because they were the most oppressed groups and Yajnavalkya gave
              them a slight push forward. Due to the respect which Yajnavalkya
              came to gain, this progress acquired irrefutable acceptability.
              <br />A major boost to Yajnavalkya&apos;s eminence was provided by
              the penning down of the Mitakshara Code by Vigyaneshwara of the
              Chalukyan emperor&apos;s court at the cusp of the eleventh and
              twelfth centuries. This work, along with the Dayabhaga written by
              Jimutvahana, became the operative text for Hindu law in India for
              the next one thousand years –to be replaced substantially though
              not completely by the series of Acts relating to Hindu marriage,
              succession, adoption, and property promulgated by the Parliament
              of India within ten years of independence.
              <br />
              Vigyaneshwara was drawn to write it because of the conciseness of
              this smriti. Although the Mitakshara was a mere (if it can be
              called that) legal commentary on the Yajnavalkya Smriti, it
              eventually came to work like the codification of a codification.
              The writing of this commentary provided a solid foundation for
              Hindu Law to enable it to withstand the vicissitudes of the second
              millennium after Christ&apos;s birth. It was born in southern
              India but spread to all parts of the country (and beyond, with the
              passage of time).

              Hindu Marriage: Stagnation during Muslim Rule

              <br />
              Muslim rule in India was marked mostly by oppression of the
              Hindus. There were almost no enlightened kings, and even after the
              rulers had lived in India for generations, they referred to
              themselves as descendants of some foreign emperors, e.g. Timur /
              Taimur Lang / Tamerlane, or Changez Khan, or some other. Hindus
              were taxed at a higher rate because of their religion, they were
              not given high positions in the court or the bureaucracy, and they
              were forcibly converted to Islam.
              <br />
              Instead of a king being responsible for the welfare of his people,
              the concepts of a policy of blood and iron, and Jaziya (religion
              based tax) were introduced. It became commonplace to refer to the
              king as Zil-e-Ilahi or the shadow of God. Hindu fathers vied with
              each other to give their daughters in marriage to Muslim nobles or
              high officers. Hindu kings gave their daughters to the ruler of
              Delhi. Muslims were therefore recognised in effect as a higher
              caste than the highest Hindus, because Hindu society was not yet
              ripe enough to let go of the tradition of marrying into a higher
              caste. Most of these women were no better than concubines, though.
              <br />
              Despite all this oppression –which lasted about one millennium–
              India remained a Hindu majority country. But Hindu culture was
              pushed down to a level where philosophical, social, cultural, and
              scientific progress came down to almost zero. Social
              stratification in castes occurred. Caste, which used to be
              dependent upon occupation and perceived intellectual worth became
              impossible to change. Till date in our country a man can change
              his religion but he cannot change his caste. Introduction of newer
              and more oppressive social norms became commonplace. Hindu
              matrimonial law was no exception to this phenomenon. Manu&apos;s
              laws were further twisted to create more sadistic versions.
              <br />
              One rule is worth mentioning in this context to show the way
              Manu&apos;s rules were contorted. Manu had said that a Brahman has
              to take a Brahman lady as his first wife, and a woman from any
              other caste as his second wife. Similar rules obtained for the two
              other twice-born castes. The creative interpretation that came to
              prevail in these times was that a Brahman could only take a lady
              from his own caste as his first wife, a Kshatriya girl as his
              second wife, a Vaishya girl as his third wife, and a girl from any
              caste as his fourth or subsequent wife. Kshatriyas were restricted
              to women one step below Brahmans in each marriage. So on and so
              forth for the other two castes.
              <br />A variation of this rule was that a Brahman could have upto
              four wives (or even more, depending upon who you were talking to),
              a Kshatriya could have upto three wives, a Vaishya not more than
              two wives, and a &apos;Shudra&apos; not more than one wife. The
              number of permitted wives in the case of the twice-born castes was
              sometimes mentioned as three, two, and one respectively.
              <br />
              Sati, or widow-burning came to be practiced with great vigour in
              this era, especially amongst the Kshatriya caste, and such women
              came to be glorified by historians. a great example is Queen
              Padmini of Chittor in Rajpootana, who is deified to this day in
              Rajasthan and in Indian history books for her refusal to submit to
              the lust of Alauddin Khilji –preferring her husband&apos;s funeral
              pyre instead of pride of place in the emperor&apos;s seraglio.
              Social reformers in the nineteenth century tried to eliminate this
              practice but failed to achieve their goal. Even in latter day
              India, examples like Roop Kanwar abound. Roop Kanwar was a woman
              who was forcibly burned on the day of her dead husband&apos;s
              cremation, on the same pyre where he was cremated, late in the
              20th century. A small cult grew around her, and she was deified by
              large numbers of people as Sati Mata. Today, this practice has
              finally been relegated to the dustbin of history.Sikhism was born
              in this era. It came to be as a result of the oppression which
              emanated from Delhi. The Khalsa Panth was the original name of
              this religion in those days, as it still is. Sikhism banned the
              caste system in theory, though in practice they were only able to
              eliminate the Brahman caste from their caste hierarchy.
              Inter-caste marriage in Sikhism also was rare, and Sikhs to this
              day continue to refer to each other&apos;s gotras. Even community
              leaders are known by their gotras, such as Sidhu, Brar, Cheema,
              Bajwa, Arora, Malhotra, Walia, etc.
              <br />
              The Khalsa Panth wedding ceremony was given the title Anand Karaj,
              and it consisted of four circumambulations, as against the
              variable number of circumambulations (nominally seven) in the
              Paanigrahan Sanskaar ritual practiced by Hindus. The presence of
              the Adi Granth Guru Granth Sahib was made mandatory during the
              wedding, as was the recitation of four Lavans, one Lavan for each
              circumambulation.
              <br />
              Brahmans were dominant in Bengal amongst Hindus throughout the
              second millennium, as they have been since times immemorial, and
              as they are today in the Indian part of Bengal. The dominance of
              the Brahmins –who depended on the widespread and continues
              prevalence of superstition amongst Hindu masses for their
              prosperity– was the reason for lack of social progress and
              continued sway of entrenched, age-old beliefs in this part of the
              country.
              <br />
              Kulin Brahmans were at the peak of the Brahman caste. This fact,
              combined with continued faith in Anuloma, and forbiddance of
              Pratiloma caused a significant distortion in gender relations.
              Since it was difficult for parents of high caste girls to find
              grooms who were of the same or a higher caste, men of the Kulin
              Brahman sub-caste used to be offered women in marriage even after
              they were already married. This led to widespread practice of
              polygamy in this sub-caste. In time, these men came to be offered
              women from lower-castes also. It became socially acceptable for
              such men to have a number of wives, as also for parents of girls
              all over the province to offer their daughters in marriage to such
              men.

              India has practically never attacked any country in more than 5000
              years of its history. It has indeed been an insular country
              traditionally –not very interested in the world outside its
              borders. This may have changed dramatically in the globalised
              world, but Indians prefer to talk about their own country most of
              the time; much like Americans or Russians or Chinese –though to a
              lesser degree.
              <br />
              Europe, one the other hand, was interested in the Orient, and in
              India since ancient times. Alexander the Great invaded India 326
              years before Christ. Megasthenes became an ambassador to the
              Mauryan Court around the same year. These arrivals were mythically
              predated by the arrivals of Hercules and Dionysus in India. The
              visits of Hercules and Dionysus to India were an integral part of
              Greek folklore.
              <br />
              Thereafter, there was no famous visitor from Europe for almost one
              and a half millennia. This was perhaps due to the dark ages and
              turmoil in Europe. The long absence was finally broken by Marco
              Polo in the year 1292, when he landed on the Malabar coast in
              present day Kerala. Marco Polo was extremely impressed by the
              riches of the Malabar region and its king. He went back to Europe
              and described India as a region full of gold and diamonds. When
              word got around Europe, a number of monarchs, nobles and rich men
              decided to send men to this fabled country to establish trade or
              to benefit from its riches in whatever manner possible.
              <br />
              This contributed in large measure to the age of discovery. The
              desires of Ferdinand Magellan, Christopher Columbus, Vasco Da
              Gama, and James Cook to explore the world can all be traced back
              to Marco Polo&apos;s voyages and his subsequent description of the
              riches of the Orient. There were a number of other explorers, but
              this is not a piece about how colonialism came to be established,
              so we will skip the details in this regard. Suffice it to say that
              the British came to rule over India after a period of struggle and
              triumph.
              <br />
              Though the British came to India from the west, they first
              established their stronghold in the eastern part of India, in the
              province of Bengal. They had a large amount of interaction with
              the locals in this province, and their understanding of India was
              greatly influenced by this experience. In return, the elite
              amongst Bengalis were greatly influenced by their colonial rulers.
              As a matter of fact, educated and prosperous Bengalis have a
              strong connection with Britain and the west till date.
              <br />
              The elite in Bengal in those days consisted of the Muslim nobility
              and the Hindu Brahmans. The British understanding of
              religion-based personal law was influenced by the insights which
              they gained while interacting with these classes. Polygamy was
              rampant amongst Brahmans in Bengal at this time, and more so
              amongst Kulin Brahmins. The British also brought along their own
              set prejudices from their native country. Women in Europe in those
              days did not have any property rights, and they were not much more
              than chattel for their husbands. The Indian situation was only
              marginally better.
              <br />
              Another thing which was common in both countries was child
              marriage. In India this was a phenomenon which was extreme in
              nature. Hindu girls were married off even before they reached
              puberty, and the marriages were consummated either immediately or
              after a variable period of time, depending upon which part of
              India you were in. Sati was being practiced in many parts of India
              amongst certain classes, and the imperial masters found this
              practice abominable. This revulsion was generated in part by the
              free association of many Indian ladies with European men, which
              was not objected to by the locals, since they considered the
              Europeans to be their masters. (This has a parallel in many
              cultures and sub-cultures across the world, where men have been
              known to offer their daughters, sisters, or even their wives to
              men whom they consider to be superior to themselves in some way.
              Much before the British men became the rulers of Indians, the
              Indian fondness for fair skin meant that the British arrivals
              found themselves interacting with the elite of society. Immigrants
              from Africa could not hope for similar treatment, as can be seen
              from the history of the Siddis. Even today, white skinned
              foreigners are given special treatment in India and Indian
              cities.)
              <br />
              As they settled down to rule the local masses, the British decided
              to codify the personal law of their subjects. To paraphrase
              Hobson, &quot;...the initial British rulers of India were
              representatives of a commercial organisation called the East India
              Company, and they had carnivorous instincts where the acquisition
              of money was concerned. They did not bother much about governing
              the natives. Things became better and the rulers started to care
              about the locals as time passed and the influence of the UK
              government on the governance of India increased. The arriving
              rulers came from a society which was growing increasingly obsessed
              with social reform, and they sought to replicate their experience
              in the country which they were ruling. The rulers had also started
              to feel that Empire was the reason because of which they had to
              emancipate the lesser races of the world. Indeed the world had
              never seen any empire grow at such a rate (paraphrased).&quot;
              (Hobson, K.; Ethnographic Mapping and the Construction of the
              British Census in India / Britain and the Indian Caste System;
              www. britishempire .co.uk / castesystem .htm; viewed on 10th
              August 2013 in Delhi). They started this &apos;emancipation&apos;
              by classifying the natives broadly on the basis of their religion,
              and treating them as different categories of people insofar as
              personal law was concerned. Customary personal law variations
              amongst regions, castes, and other groups continued more
              unhindered by the rulers than not.
              <br />
              The British took the rather naive view that since Brahmans were
              the topmost caste in the caste hierarchy, therefore they should be
              humoured and given the highest rank in the administration as far
              as natives were allowed to go. This was partly a consequence of
              their twin desires to actually govern this country and –before
              that– to make sense of the gigantic complexity that India was,
              using caste amongst other things as a classifier. Their view took
              off from a point where each caste was seen as having definite
              traits. In this respect and at that point in history, they were
              not far from the truth. Another reason for keeping Brahmans at the
              top was the natural predilection of the British to deal
              exclusively or mostly with people who belonged to the topmost
              strata of society in this country. The British rulers, after all,
              came from a country which was highly class conscious.
              <br />A major component of their plan to rule India was to allow
              people of all religions to be governed in their personal affairs
              by their traditional religious law. Marriage, adoption,
              inheritance, etc. were natural choices as subject matter for such
              laws. Initial attempts at codification of Hindu religious laws
              were nothing more than discovering the textual basis for various
              life events and relationships, and translating this material to
              the language of the masters. Indeed, all the ancient texts which
              are referred to by modern commentators on Hindu marriage were
              originally translated from the vernacular (or Sanskrit) to English
              during British rule. Colebrooke&apos;s Digest and Halhed&apos;s
              Gentoo Code are major examples of British collated translations.
              <br />
              Sati was seen as a social evil by the rulers, and they made
              significant and recorded efforts to stamp it out. Although
              initially they tried to regulate the practice of Sati, ultimately
              they got fed up and Lord Bentinck banned the practice in 1829.
              This was a major step towards eliminating the system of using
              marriage as a license for murder.
              <br />
              Another type of murder which occurred in a marital setting was
              what is called dowry murder.
              <br />
              The assertion that the dowry system grew to monstrous proportions
              during British colonial rule in India is very convenient for
              nationalists. Oldenburg claims rather facetiously that the
              dispossession of Indian women was perpetrated by the imperialists
              from Europe. (Oldenburg, V.T.; Dowry Murder: The Imperial Origins
              of a Cultural Crime; throughout the text; Oxford University Press;
              USA; 2002). Marriage in ancient India was by and large not seen as
              a financial transaction. This remains true today, and there is no
              persuasive reason to think that this was not true in British India
              also.
              <br />A word which was used as a synonym for &apos;Hindu&apos; in
              those days is &apos;Gentoo&apos;.
              <br />
              Adopting a child was an ancient custom which was permitted by
              custom to married and childless Hindu couples. Interestingly,
              although adopted children of ordinary Hindus were allowed to
              inherit their parents&apos; property, adopted children of native
              rulers in princely states were not permitted to sit on the throne.
              In such cases the princely state got merged into British India
              upon the death of the ruler in question. This law was promulgated
              during the rule of Lord Dalhousie, and it was the direct cause of
              the war in 1857. It was known as the Doctrine of Lapse. (Another
              provision in this law was that the British government was given
              the power to dismiss any ruler who was deemed incompetent by it.)
              Apart from this departure, the colonial rulers did their best to
              make sure that children inherited their parents&apos; wealth. This
              can especially be seen in the Caste and Disabilities Removal Act
              of 1950, which prohibited the disenfranchisement of children from
              their parental property if they did something which caused them to
              lose their caste.
              <br />
              Initially the British adjudicated Hindu matrimonial disputes, and
              indeed other disputes, with the help of Court Pandits, but later
              on they ejected these men, after having developed a massive body
              of case law, which also served as the foundation for a series of
              laws which they promulgated in fits and starts. William
              Jones&apos; Digest of Hindu Law on Contracts and Succession and
              Sir Thomas Strange&apos;s Elements of Hindu Law were major
              landmarks in their effort to codify Hindu law relating to marriage
              and other matters.
              <br />
              Polygamy amongst Hindus was permitted to continue by the British.
              Child marriage also remained a common and indeed predominant form
              of marriage, with a fairly large part of the female population
              being subjected to marriage much before they reached puberty.
              Readers are probably familiar with the lives of the many national
              leaders who got married when their brides were but little girls.

              <br />
              England in the eighteenth century was a society which was a
              democracy in name, but was ruled by a class of people who had
              their fingers in every pie from Commons to Lords. The 3rd Duke of
              Portland was a member of this class of people, and he was born to
              rule by virtue of the family in which he was born. He received his
              education at the finest schools, and mingled with the cream of
              society from childhood. He went on to hold every rank of peerage
              from Baron to Duke, and later became the Prime Minister of England
              not once but twice. He also had the honour of holding the position
              of the Leader of the House in the House of Lords.
              <br />
              He was, incidentally, one of the direct ancestors of the present
              queen of England through her maternal line. (This last is not
              something exceptional since half the nobility of Europe in those
              days were direct ancestors of Elizabeth II, although they probably
              did not suspect it then). He had six children –one of whom was the
              man we remember today as Lord William Bentinck.
              <br />
              Lord Bentinck was a lieutenant general, a governor, a
              governor-general, and an elected member of parliament in his life
              of 64 years, apart from being a member of the British nobility by
              birth. He also had a ship named after him within his lifetime, and
              he declined a peerage and a membership of the House of Lords. Lord
              Bentinck was the last governor-general of the presidency of Fort
              William in the former united Bengal. The East India Company
              appointed him to the post in 1828. He subsequently became the
              first governor-general of India in 1833, and remained in office
              till 1835. He is sometimes confused with his brother (the 4th Duke
              of Portland) or his father, who had the same first name –William–
              as him.
              <br />
              Earlier on, he had become Governor of Madras at the age of 29 in
              1803 due to the good offices of his father. He had a tenure of
              about 4 years, and had to leave in 1807 due to a mutiny in Vellore
              triggered by his insistence to uphold an order which the native
              soldiers resented. The GoC of Madras had forbidden native soldiers
              from wearing turbans and beards, and Bentinck had upheld the
              order. This was nothing strange, coming as it did from an
              Englishman. It is not unknown in England for offices and banks to
              declare that beards may be worn by gentlemen employees, but not
              during office hours. India being India, the order was not received
              with much enthusiasm –indeed, with outright hostility and
              rebellion.
              <br />
              Bentinck decided that he had to come back to India to prove his
              worth again. India, after all, was the Jewel in the Crown. His
              family also had some history with India. The first government of
              the 3rd Duke of Portland had fallen when the coalition which he
              headed (called the Fox-North Coalition) tried to push through a
              bill nationalising the East India Company.
              <br />
              Lord Bentinck was a kind though pragmatic man who had acquired a
              deep-seated belief in the principle of the greater good for the
              greater number of people. A number of commentators have attributed
              his belief in this principle to the influence of Jeremy Bentham
              and John Stuart Mill. There may be some substance in this logic
              but it is the sum total of a man&apos;s experience which shapes
              him, and Bentinck was a man who had travelled far and wide –and
              had met more people than anybody except the most privileged people
              in that era could. It might therefore be incorrect to attribute
              his belief solely to the influence of one or two men. He came from
              a liberal family, and his ideas would have been considered
              unconventional to the extent of being disruptive in the time and
              place to which he belonged –had it not been for his solid family
              background, which helped him to mainstream his ideas within his
              lifetime.Bentinck came back to India after a gap of more than two
              decades, during which he had helped Sicily to establish its first
              written Constitution, and to abolish feudalism(!) He came here to
              turn around the fortunes of the East India Company, which was
              making losses in India, and was at risk of losing its charter to
              rule India. He was appointed by the shortest serving Prime
              Minister in the history of Britain. George Canning. Canning was
              married to the sister of Lord Bentincks&apos;s brother&apos;s
              wife, and he had served as Foreign Secretary during the second
              prime ministerial administration of the 3rd Duke of Portland. The
              3rd Duke of Portland –as mentioned earlier– was Lord
              Bentinck&apos;s father.
              <br />
              The East India Company was at risk of losing its charter to govern
              India due to the losses which it was incurring. Bentinck was
              tasked with turning it around, and turn it around he did.
              <br />
              Bentinck cut the batta (active duty) allowance of the soldiery in
              India, and curtailed increases in the salaries of the civil
              service, a cadre of 416 officers which was the precursor of the
              modern day IAS. He introduced a direct licensing system for opium
              farmers to send their produce directly from their villages to
              Bombay, with the East India Company taking a share of the profits.
              He also reorganised the land revenue system in many parts of the
              country. Thus he was able to turn around the fortunes of the
              company, and its charter was renewed by the British government,
              though its commercial activities were abolished by the Whig
              government which ruled the UK in 1833 under Earl Grey. The company
              was reduced to a purely administrative role (just as
              Bentinck&apos;s father had desired in his time) and Bentinck was
              appointed the first Governor-General of India.
              <br />
              Bentinck shut down the circuit courts of appeal in the provinces.
              These courts were causing unbearable delays and much pain to
              petitioners, prisoners, prosecutors, and witnesses, because the
              judges took six month holidays between hearings. The prisoners
              were held for all that time, and the rest of the parties had to
              wait or to hang around at their own expense.
              <br />
              He changed the language of the courts from Persian to the
              vernacular in the lower courts. In the higher courts he introduced
              English. He also appointed Indian judges, and was the first
              British administrator of India to do so. He made Indian judges
              eligible to adjudicate disputes between natives of up to 300
              rupees, as also criminal cases, and gave them the charge of Boards
              of Revenue and Sadar Nizamat Adalats –which were the lowest
              courts. He also set up a second tier of courts run by Indians,
              which were called munsif courts. Another level of courts –the
              highest level administered by Indians exclusively– were the Sadar
              Amin courts. Europeans remained judges of higher courts for the
              most part, though a few Indians were allowed to sit on the bench
              of these higher courts too. It can be seen in these actions that
              he was a proponent of the right to equality, which became a
              cornerstone of free India&apos;s Constitution in the 20th century.
              <br />
              Lord Bentinck is claimed to have been interested in establishing a
              free Press in India by his admirers, although this is not borne
              out by at least one of his recorded comments in which he said that
              a free Press can lead to the spread of knowledge in India, and
              endanger British rule in this country. Charles Metcalfe –who was
              one of Bentinck&apos;s ablest lieutenants along with Mackenzie– is
              usually credited with taking the first concrete steps towards a
              free Press in India during his tenure as the acting
              Governor-General of India. Metcalfe Hall, a major landmark in
              Calcutta, was built to commemorate Metcalfe&apos;s contribution in
              this direction. He was also honoured a number of times by the
              Bengali elite for his efforts.
              <br />
              Bentinck deemed the practices of tantric child sacrifice and Sati
              savagery of the worst kind. He banned both of these, and he made
              great strides in finishing off the menace of Thuggee or thuggery,
              which was practiced by thugs in India. The English word
              &apos;thug&apos; is of Indian origin. Sir William Henry Sleeman
              carried out Bentinck&apos;s mandate with great energy, and
              practically wiped out this variety of bandit from the face of this
              country within the span of a decade.
              <br />
              Bentinck tried to implement the traditional law which made it
              illegal for Hindus to convert to Islam and still remain eligible
              to inherit wealth from their parents. He did this through the
              Hindu Law of Inheritance, 1832. This was praised by Hindus and
              condemned by Muslims, who had traditionally not allowed this law
              to function by virtue of being occupants of all judges&apos;
              positions under Muslim rule in India. Hindus had traditionally
              been forced or allured to convert to Islam, and the Muslim judges
              had ensured that these converts got their inheritance even after
              abandoning their religion. This action was to later find resonance
              in the Hindu Marriage Act in 1955, in the provision relating to
              conversion.
              <br />
              Bentinck also made it illegal to bar native Hindu or Muslim
              converts to Christianity from public service. This was –again– one
              of the practices which the British had inherited from their Muslim
              predecessors. He made it illegal for caste, religion, or ethnicity
              to hinder anyone from government service. This provision was later
              seen in Article 14 of the Indian Constitution more than a hundred
              years later.
              <br />
              Bentinck realised that European officers in India were being paid
              exorbitant salaries. He wanted to cut this expenditure down to as
              low an amount as possible in order to increase the revenue
              generated by the company. Indian men could not do their job
              because they were not conversant with the English language to the
              extent needed. Local men in Calcutta were also clamouring to learn
              English and European science and literature. Added to tht was
              Bentinck&apos;s desire as a nationalist to propagate British
              culture.
              <br />
              There were opposing forces in the form of orientalists like Horace
              Wilson, to be sure; but there were also great allies like Thomas
              Macaulay (who was the first law member of the
              governor-general&apos;s council), and Macaulay&apos;s
              brother-in-law, Sir Charles Trevelyan. He was also greatly
              influenced in this (as indicated earlier in this piece) by the
              utilitarian ideas of John Stuart Mill, one of the great
              influencers of his liberal ideology along with his (Whig) party,
              his father, and Jeremy Bentham.
              <br />
              Macaulay implememented Bentinck&apos;s initiative in a concrete
              fashion, and is to this day credited with the introduction of
              English medium education in this country.

              <br />
              Lawmaking was a process which was inherent to the system which the
              British used to govern themselves. They were nominally a
              democratic country, and they practiced lawmaking by the rule of
              the majority. It stands to reason that they wished to provide at
              least a facade of a certain minimum level of consultation before
              they promulgated laws in the territories ruled by them –and
              especially in the biggest country amongst the countries which were
              under their rule.
              <br />
              The system which the British used to govern India, in terms of
              lawmaking kept on being modified from time to time. There was, for
              a very long time, legislation without a legislature. Eventually a
              legislature was established –and it grew in its role and power
              till it reached the point when it became the parliament of free
              India.
              <br />
              British India at that time was defined as the territories governed
              directly or indirectly by the British in India plus Burma and
              Aden. As a matter of fact, Burma and Aden remained a part of
              British India till 1937. Needless to add, Pakistan and Bangladesh
              were parts of India at that time. That map of Bharat Mata which
              you see in in pictures of Bharat Mata personified is actually a
              map of British India. To confuse the issue further, British India
              was also the name given to those areas within India which were
              directly governed by the British.
              <br />
              The Calcutta Council was established in 1773 by the British
              government through the East India Company Act of 1773 aka
              Regulating Act. This act made the earliest attempt to ensure
              corruption-free working of a government in India which was
              governed at some level by elected men (albeit a highly bastardised
              version of democracy). Employees of the company were forbidden
              from taking gifts or carrying out private business. It consisted
              of four voting members other than the governor-general –and the
              governor general had a casting vote in addition to an ordinary
              vote. The council was a legislative as well as an executive body.
              The judiciary was anglicised with the establishment of a supreme
              court in Fort William by the same Act.
              <br />
              The only authority which could overrule the Calcutta Council was
              the court of directors of the East India Company which, in turn,
              could be overruled by the British government. It appears due to
              this fact and the fact that the court of directors of the East
              India Company elected the members of the council that the council
              members were less powerful than the directors of the East India
              Company.
              <br />
              This is not correct. Many directors of the company stood for
              election to the council, and they were often not elected by the
              rest of the directors. The great distance to India, and the
              resultant unsupervised governance over this nation that the
              members of the Council of India and the governor general
              exercised, ensured that these men were recognised as puissant
              figures even in their day. However, the governor-general remained
              the most powerful man in India. This fact is borne out by history.
              Warren Hastings did manage get rid of all the members of the
              council (or the Council of Four as it was known) one by one. It
              must however be appreciated that the men who were in government
              and those who were in the company came from the same aristocracy
              which ruled Britain.In 1784 the powers of the East India Company
              were amended by the East India Company Act of 1784 aka Pitt&apos;s
              India Act. Legislative supremacy was formally put in the hands of
              the Privy Council of Great Britain. The cabinet exercised all the
              powers of the privy council, being nothing but its most powerful
              committee de jure. This is being called a formal transfer because
              veto power had always been in the hands of the cabinet. The
              governor general got the power to overrule the governing council
              of the East India Company, and thereby encroached in large measure
              on the counsellors&apos; turf. A Board of Control was established
              under the cabinet to oversee the court of directors of the
              company.
              <br />
              Another East India Company Act, the Charter Act of 1793 made the
              approval of the monarch essential for the appointment of the
              governor-general, the commander-in-chief of the army, and the
              governors of the (two subordinate) presidencies of Madras and
              Bombay. The financial burden of the board of control was passed to
              the company from the government.
              <br />
              The Charter Act of 1813 again renewed the company&apos;s charter
              for twenty years. More powers shifted from company to crown with
              this Act.
              <br />
              All pretence of consultation in lawmaking ended with the
              Government of India Act of 1833 when the British government once
              again extended the charter of the East India Company to govern
              British India. The Governor-General of Bengal (Lord William
              Bentinck) became the Governor-General of India, and sweeping
              legislative powers were given to him over the presidencies of
              Madras and Bombay too, since they were both parts of India. The
              governing council was now renamed the Council of India. The
              governor general could carry out all his executive functions
              single-handedly or &apos;in council&apos;, but his legislative
              functions could be attenuated by this Council of India. Although
              he could do whatever he wanted to do in this role too.
              <br />
              The reaction to the revolt of 1857 was that the British government
              decided to do away with the East India Company in toto, and
              brought in legislation to effect this change by the name of the
              Government of India Act of 1858.
              <br />
              In 1858 the rule of the East India Company was ended by the
              British Government, and the company was liquidated. The Secretary
              of State for India came to be the point man for India in the
              British cabinet. He headed the India office which was the office
              mandated to supervise the Viceroy of India, which was the new and
              additional title given to the Governor General of India. The role
              of the Council of India was now to advise the India Secretary –and
              this council was now shifted to London from Fort William. It was
              enlarged to 15 members, and the members could be appointed only by
              the Secretary of State for India. One member could be appointed by
              the monarch.
              <br />
              The India Secretary could bypass the council and could form
              committees from within the council for various special purposes.
              The council which remained in Fort William was renamed the Council
              of the Governor General of India. This council now had three
              members who were nominated by the India Secretary and on who was
              to be nominated by the monarch. An Indian Civil Service was also
              established to rule the territories of British India. All power
              came to the crown because the company was dissolved.
              <br />
              In 1861 the Indian Councils Act made it possible for the
              governor-general to nominate from 6 upto 12 members to the India
              Council and for the India Secretary to nominate 3 members. The
              monarch could nominate 2 members. The members who were nominated
              by the India Secretary and the monarch were more powerful inasmuch
              as they were given executive roles in addition to legislative
              powers &apos;in council&apos;, while the ones who were nominated
              were only able to debate and vote in the lawmaking process, and
              possessed only residual executive powers.
              <br />
              As can be seen from the foregoing, the growth of the legislature
              began to pick up speed after the 1857 revolt. In 1869 the power to
              nominate the five executive members of the India Council was
              transferred to the cabinet –and in effect, to the Prime Minister.
              In 1892 the new Indian Councils Act raised the number of members
              with purely legislative powers to a fixed number of sixteen
              members, from the earlier six to twelve members. Indian members
              were admitted to this enlarged council, which was the first time
              in the history of British rule in India that Indians were being
              given a role in lawmaking for the whole country. Pherozeshah Mehta
              and Gopalkrishna Gokhale were two eminent members who also
              happened to be members of the Indian National Congress, which had
              been founded by Allan Octavian Hume in 1886.
              <br />
              In 1909 there was a major change. The Indian Council was broken
              into the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council and an Imperial
              Legislative Council of 60 members (including 27 elected members),
              with executive and legislative functions separated between them.
              Many eminent Indian including Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Tej Bahadur
              Sapru, and Bhim Rao Ambedkar were to become members of the
              executive council in later years. The Imperial Legislative Council
              went from strength to strength on the lawmaking front. It had many
              eminent Indians as members. This included Vithalbhai Patel, Madan
              Mohan Malviya, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, S.N. Bannerji, and the Raja
              of Pratapgarh. State legislatures were also set up by the imperial
              government.
              <br />
              In 1920 the Imperial Legislative Council was further split by the
              Government of India Act of 1919 into the Central Legislative
              Assembly and the Council of State, which were the forerunners of
              our present bicameral legislature. Moti Lal Nehru, Lala Lajpat
              Rai, Madan Mohan Malviya etc. were a few of the members of these
              legislative bodies.
              <br />
              If you look at the men who inherited power as freedom fighters in
              1947, you will see that many of them already had served as
              legislators with limited legislative powers under British rule.
              Some of them were genuine freedom fighters -like Ambedkar, Rai,
              Bannerjee and yes, the formidable lawyer, Jinnah- who had fought
              for the creation of these legislatures and for the right to permit
              no taxation without representation. However, some of these
              &apos;freedom fighters&apos; were not really freedom fighters, but
              were toadies or children of toadies. It is beyond the scope of
              this article to pick out who they were, but feel free to criticise
              as long as you do not violate laws governing slander.
              <br />
              In 1946 the Cabinet Mission ordered the creation of the interim
              Indian goverment consisting of men like Nehru, Patel, Rajendra
              Prasad, and Liaquat Ali Khan. This was the final step under the
              British Raj in the progress towards a free Indian legislature.

              Lord Cornwallis, the Governor General of Bengal promulgated the
              Cornwallis Code or the Bengal Code in 1793. This set of laws was
              used to govern British India till the promulgation of the Charter
              Act in 1833. In 1829 Lord Bentinck promulgated the Bengal Sati
              Regulation aka Regulation XVII, A. D. 1829 of the Bengal Code.
              This was the first law made by the British government to mitigate
              the oppression wrought upon women due to their marriage with a man
              who subsequently died an untimely death. Widows in that part of
              India were often burnt at the pyre of their dead husbands.
              <br />
              The idea of compelling a woman to die ­–that is to say, to murder
              her– in the event of her husband&apos;s death came from hoary
              gender-biased concepts which came to be due to ignorance. The
              &apos;guardians&apos; of society did not feel the need to murder a
              woman when her father died. Nor when her mother died. Or when her
              brother died. But they felt the need to murder her when her
              husband died. Why was this so? The only plausible explanation is
              that the husband was deemed to own her vagina, and that the vagina
              had to go to heaven or hell with the husband, where he would
              continue to use this facility afforded him by Manu of the Smriti.
              Manu, as has been mentioned elsewhere in this website, had
              declared that only virgins could be given away in marriage.
              Therefore the oppression of widows arose directly from the law
              related to marriage. Interestingly if you combine the explicit
              instruction that only a virgin was eligible to be given away as a
              bride with the total ownership of a woman&apos;s vagina by one
              man, and multiply it by 72, you reach a point where your logic
              approaches the logic used by the creators of the &apos;72 virgins
              waiting in heaven for dead jihadists&apos; concept, which has been
              much talked about in recent times.
              <br />
              Bentinck did his bit to eradicate this oppression. The Bengal Sati
              Regulation (decreed at the cusp of the Victorian era by the
              governor general in council) is a great example of a law which
              contributed to the reduction of the oppression of women in
              marriage. As an aside let me mention that I remember a young
              frenemy from Auckland who said that the Indian and Sri Lankan
              obsession with virginity was a remnant of colonial oppression.
              Bentinck was a colonial master, the highest of the lords in the
              entire Indian sub-continent, a veritable king of kings. And he was
              born before the dawn of the Victorian era. He could be said to be
              the archetypal patriarch. Indeed he could not just be said to be
              such a one, he was one. A number of historians, feminists, social
              scientists would have us believe that such a man would be
              incapable of thinking about the general good of women. Why then
              was he trying to stop the oppression of Indian women? One possible
              explanation here is that the man can be greater than the system,
              if he is an exceptional man. (Bentinck, as has been mentioned
              elsewhere in this website, was no ordinary man. He signalled the
              end of the medieval age in India, in my humble opinion.) Another
              is that the oppression of women in the Victorian era in England
              has been exaggerated by historians.
              <br />
              The Caste Disabilities Removal Act was promulgated in 1850, in
              keeping with the way laws were forced upon the Indian people
              during the Raj. It quashed all provisions of any law which
              prevented a convert from getting any or all privileges which he
              would have got under those laws had he remained a follower of his
              original religion. This Act is often described as a path breaking
              law. The fact of the matter is that there was not too much that
              was path breaking about this law, except extending a legal
              provision from the territory of one state of India to the whole of
              India. Lord Bentinck had already decreed –eighteen years before
              this Act– section 9 of regulation vii of the Bengal Code. The Act
              itself did not claim to be path breaking. It clearly mentioned in
              its preamble that it was only extending Bentinck&apos;s law to the
              territory of the whole of India.The path taken by this law after
              the birth of the modern day republic of India and the
              &apos;modern&apos; republic of Pakistan is instructive in terms of
              revealing the degree of legitimacy of these republics. In India
              there continues to be full freedom to convert to any religion. A R
              Rehman is one example of a man who converted from Hinduism to
              Islam, and this fact did not stop the Indian people from letting
              him grow into a musical superstar. Any man can convert to any
              religion and any woman can convert to any religion. The only
              limitation is that if a Muslim converts to Hinduism then he can
              longer claim the right to marry four women. However he can
              continue to have normal marital relations with any number of wives
              –permitted by Muslim personal law– whom he married before his
              conversion to Hinduism. In Pakistan today, not only does a person
              lose the right to inherit property if he abandons Islam, he
              forfeits the very right to live.
              <br />
              It is not that Bentinck managed to free Indian society from
              oppression totally. He did not have that kind of power over the
              British government. Oppression continued, and the imperialists
              made some extremely sadistic laws, like the Madras Compulsory
              Labour Act for example.
              <br />
              The Indian Penal Code, written by Macaulay, and enacted in 1860,
              after his death, was a mix of good and bad. It was a great
              introductory step in the promotion of the rule of law, but some
              provisions were reflective of a backward mindset. The sections
              relating to adultery for example, treated the lover of the wife as
              a criminal and not the wife herself. The fact of the matter is
              that adultery qua the husband cannot take place if the wife is not
              the prime mover. Also there was no provision for punishing
              straying husbands or their lovers. This law continues to this day.
              It only provided a pretence of a civilised country by virtue of
              its label. But the law is pretty much worthless, and can only be
              used for the oppression of men.
              <br />
              The Converts Marriage Dissolution Act of 1866 introduced the
              concept of divorce to Indian law. It was also the first time that
              the idea of restitution of conjugal rights was put in a statute.
              The latter idea is wonderful in theory, and purports to provide
              legal backing to marriage in terms of preserving its sanctity.
              However it is not really a workable concept unless backed up with
              the threat of punishment as can be seen by the total lack of
              utility in the RCR provision (section 9) of the Hindu Marriage
              Act. This Act provided for the dissolution of marriage in the
              event of non compliance by the offending party. It is not clear to
              this writer whether this was done in good faith or was simply a
              sly way of permitting the legal death of dead marriages.

              <br />A few months earlier, the Indian Succession Act of 1865 had
              set into law the inheritability of husband&apos;s property or
              wife&apos;s property by the survivor in the event of the death of
              one of them. The earlier distinction between movable and immovable
              property –or &apos;personalty&apos; and realty– was eliminated for
              the purpose of the creation of an interest of spouses in each
              other&apos;s property upon death. The wife&apos;s personal
              property brought into the marriage at the time of solemnisation of
              the marriage was now recognised as being exclusively usable as per
              her wishes, and the husband was required to take her permission to
              use the same. This was later elevated to the status of Stridhan in
              the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955. The husband was given the same
              protection vis-à-vis his property. (The protection given to the
              husband was eroded and chipped away by a number of laws after
              independence which contained portions related to property. No
              single omnibus law was enacted in free India which told the
              husband in clear terms that his right to his lawfully earned or
              inherited property was to be severely abridged. This is an
              unfortunate historical series of steps, although it would be
              incorrect to see any master plan behind this continuing trend.)
              <br />
              To understand more clearly the law in terms of the apparent
              contradiction between creation of an interest in the spouse&apos;s
              property and proscription of an interest in the spouse&apos;s
              property, please note that the creation of an interest in the
              spouse&apos;s property was to happen only in the event of the
              death of that spouse. The concept of a pre-nuptial agreement was
              also introduced in this Act for the first time in Indian history.
              <br />
              The rights of children born out of any marriage were also
              delineated in this Act, including but not limited to inheritance
              of property and domicile. The law also attempted to provide a
              durable legal definition of intestacy and consanguinity. The
              devolution of a dead man&apos;s property was to be more just under
              this law than under contemporary English law, by firstly
              prohibiting the state from getting any share in it unless he died
              with no inheritors at all. Secondly, by rejecting the English
              notion that gifts given by a father to his children during his
              lifetime should be deducted from their share in his property at
              the time of his death. The force of lex locae rei sitae was
              blunted by giving no share to anyone in their spouse&apos;s
              property by virtue of marriage regardless of local law.
              <br />A system for creating Wills, and the distinction between
              valid Wills and invalid Wills was adumbrated in the law. Section
              XII of the Act declared that nobody could dictate to his
              inheritors to whom they would like to bequeath the inherited
              property after their death. This provision was considered just by
              many and unjust by many others. Further Section XVI of the Indian
              Succession Act 1865 prohibited the imposition of illegal,
              impossible or ­immoral conditions for attaining eligibility to
              receive bequests. The third point out of these appears to be an
              arbitrary inclusion, which cannot be defined in a manner which is
              durable. It may be said that this is rightly so, but then one
              man&apos;s medicine may be another man&apos;s poison, and how can
              a judge judge this without impinging upon the right to live life
              freely. It may however be mentioned that there was no genuine
              right to life for Indian subjects of the British empire in the
              days when this Act was being put through the motions by the
              Commissioners of the Crown.
              <br />
              In 1869 the Indian Divorce Act was promulgated in order to provide
              the sorely felt need for the dissolution of Christian marriages.
              This Act was a slightly modified/pick-and-choose version of a
              series of similar laws which were enacted in the United Kingdom in
              1857, 1858, 1859, 1860, 1864, and 1866. All these laws were called
              Matrimonial Causes Acts (suffixed with their respective years).
              The Indian Act provided the granting of original jurisdiction in
              divorce matters to all the High Courts which were set up by the
              British government. The draft for the Indian Divorce Act was
              placed before the governor general in council in 1862, and it took
              them seven years to go through the law and to make changes in it
              before finally passing it in 1869. The law introduced many
              categories of matrimonial offences which could render a party
              liable to being sued for divorce, and recognised a few situations
              where a divorce could be permitted. The various categories under
              which divorce was made obtainable were as follows – adultery,
              cruelty, desertion for more than seven years, insanity for more
              than two years, incurable leprosy for more than two years,
              conversion to another religion, willful refusal to consummate the
              marriage, not being heard of for 7 years, venereal disease in
              communicable form for two years, and a failure to obey the order
              for restitution of conjugal rights. In addition to these grounds,
              the wife could sue the husband on grounds of a conviction related
              to rape, sodomy or bestiality committed by him.
              <br />
              As can be seen from foregoing, divorce was not exactly turned into
              a cakewalk for Christians in India. Almost all of the conditions
              that were provided by the law were such, that it was not possible
              to even start suing for divorce until a number of years had passed
              from the start of the matrimonial offence. The situation today is
              not much different, and Christians have it even tougher than
              Hindus in divorce matters.
              <br />
              The Indian Christian Marriage Act of 1872 was brought in soon
              after the Indian Divorce Act. This law was made to govern
              marriages between two Indians practicing the Christian religion,
              or between foreigners practicing the Christian religion, and
              marriages where one of the parties is an Indian Christian. The
              funny thing is that the Christian Marriage Act came after the Act
              governing Christian divorces, quite ironically.
              <br />
              This law prescribed the degrees of consanguinity within which
              marriage was prohibited. It also prescribed the method for
              registration of Christian marriages in India, in case the parties
              wish to get the marriage recorded or solemnised by a marriage
              registrar. It had interesting rules like the permitted time of the
              day when a marriage might be solemnised by different categories of
              people. It also adumbrated these categories of people. It also
              prescribed the procedure for submitting a notice of an intention
              to marry, and it explained how the marriage registrar was to issue
              that notice to the general public.
              <br />
              Mangalwadi claims that the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 is nothing
              but a thinly disguised copy of the Christian Marriage Act of 1872.
              His views may be considered controversial by many since he quite
              bluntly accuses Mahatma Gandhi here of sleeping with women other
              than Kasturba Gandhi in his Ashram without providing any source
              for this allegation, and connects this with the provision for
              restitution of conjugal rights. Those who feel that his
              aforementioned postulate about Gandhi&apos;s life is more than
              just that will of course deem it his observations worthy of note.

              <br />
              The Married Women&apos;s Property Act was promulgated in 1874.
              This Act lays down the extent to which a husband is liable for his
              wife&apos;s debts, incurred before and after marriage to him. Some
              parts of the Act were applicable to all followers of Christianity
              except any group(s) which was/were excluded from the Act by the
              government. Other parts of the Act were applicable to followers of
              many religions including Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains, and
              Buddhists. This act filled a gap in the previously promulgated
              Indian Succession Act of 1865. That Act had created a situation
              where although both husband and wife were given rights to continue
              to enjoy control over any property which they acquired before
              getting married, the husband was not protected from being forced
              to pay back any debts acquired by the wife prior to getting
              married.
              <br />
              The substantive provisions of the Married Women&apos;s Property
              Act of 1874 were as follows—
              <br />
              1) That a woman&apos;s earnings after she got married were to
              remain her own property, and her husband could not force her to
              spend them in any way whatsoever, except with her agreement; and
              <br />
              2) That any trust created by a husband to pay for a life insurance
              policy –whose beneficiaries in the event of his death were to be
              his wife and children– would remain a separate entity from his own
              personal finances, and that he or his creditors would have no
              claim on the monies belonging to any such trust.
              <br />
              3) Wives would here on after be entitled to sue anyone for the
              protection of their personal property.
              <br />
              4) Wives would also be liable to be sued in respect of debts
              incurred by them, and their property could be attached to recover
              any such debts.
              <br />
              5) However, if any properties were to be found to have been gifted
              to any woman with the express condition that she could enjoy them
              but could not transfer her interest in them, then any creditor
              would have no claim on such properties.
              <br />
              6) Husbands were not to be liable for payment of debts incurred by
              their wives before getting married to them.
              <br />
              7) Husbands were not to be held liable if their wives, acting
              independently, committed either breach of trust or any other
              criminal behaviour in respect of any property.
              <br />
              All these provisions were very fine provisions and were a major
              step in protecting women financially, during and after their
              husbands&apos; life. These provisions also protected children and
              men to a major extent. The Hindu Marriage Act –which was still in
              the future at the time of this Act– was to be another major
              watershed in the protection of wives&apos; property rights. But
              the criminal breach of trust provision (IPC section 406) which
              would be made applicable to all stridhan by that Act –and indeed
              the very definition of stridhan– was to become a tool of
              oppression against husbands and their parents. It is indeed an
              irony that laws made by imperial oppressors gave more protection
              to these parties than a law made by our own people.The Transfer of
              Property Act 1882 protected to a limited extent the interest of
              children or women who were being paid maintenance out of the
              proceeds from rental or lease of any property in the event of
              transfer of such property. It also provided for
              non-transferability of any sort of standalone right to sue vested
              by virtue of ownership of any property; and laid down the law on
              easements (including easement enjoyed by family members) for the
              first time in Indian legal history. There were also significant
              provisions in this Act against fraudulent transfers of property.
              <br />
              The Birth, Deaths, and Marriages Registration Act of 1886 mandated
              the establishment of registries where births, marriages and deaths
              could be recorded by family members or others. This Act also had
              an interesting feature akin to the RTI Act of 2005. This was that
              any member of the public could view the registries, and get
              information from them, subject to the payment of a fee. This is
              very interesting, coming from an imperial power.
              <br />
              The Guardians and Wards Act of 1890 was not applicable to Hindus
              per se but was an important step towards the protection of
              children inasmuch as it created an active role for the State in
              the protection of children and their property. The State was
              authorised to supervise a child&apos;s upbringing to any extent
              which it could reasonably justify, and which was in the
              child&apos;s interest. Guardians who did not look after children
              were here on after liable to be punished for acts of omission or
              commission.
              <br />
              The Marriages Validation Act of 1892 validated marriages
              solemnised in contravention of the Indian Christian Marriage Act.
              This Act was a step which reinforced the undeclared intention of
              the government that marriages were to be slowly brought under the
              pale of the State. Forces within the government intended to take
              this process to its logical culmination.

              Queen Victoria died in 1901, bringing the Victorian era to an end.
              Victoria Memorial in Calcutta is named after her, and is one of
              the many Indo-Saracenic buildings built during the Raj.
              Incidentally this memorial was mandated by a purpose made law, the
              Victoria Memorial Act, 1903. This brings to an end the short
              sub-series of articles on laws made for India during the this era.
              But there are more articles forthcoming about the road to the
              Hindu Marriage Act of 1955.

              Many laws relating to and/or affecting marriages and marital
              relations were enacted by the imperialists of the Raj during the
              19th century. Here it might be mentioned that it is a bit
              surprising that their enthusiasm for lawmaking had not extended to
              making a law governing marriages in the majority of the population
              of India, namely Hindus. As a matter of fact, Hindu marriages were
              not governed by any statute till the parliament of free India
              enacted the Hindu Marriage Act in 1955. The British Raj was to
              pass without making a relevant law or even a satisfactory attempt
              in the general direction of making a law concerning marriages
              between Hindus.
              <br />
              This writer feels that it is safe to say that all modern religions
              have their own rules concerning marriages and divorces. Such rules
              dictate inter alia things like who to marry, when to marry,
              whether divorce is permitted or not, and if it is permitted then
              how to go about it. Sikhism is one such religion. It has specific
              as well as unwritten rules concerning marriage. It is beyond the
              scope of this article to investigate where these rules can be
              found, and their extent and coverage. Most Sikhs like members of
              all other religions would naturally wish to have their own
              separate identity. Evidence of this can be seen almost every time
              whenever there is an attempt by people to include Sikhs within the
              admittedly vast rubric of Hinduism. Much time is whiled away in
              debates about whether the Shiva referred to by Guru Gobind Singh
              is the same Shiva who is worshipped by hundreds of millions of
              Hindus, and similar topics. Sometimes such debates end in strife
              perpetrated by hotheads.
              <br />
              Around the time when the imperialists from Britain had completed
              about a century of informal and formal lawmaking for India, a
              number of Sikh leaders and intellectuals decided to campaign for a
              marriage law specifically pertaining to marriages between or
              involving Sikhs. This was a natural progression from a number of
              other directions also, the first of which was the reaction to some
              events like the emergence of what are regarded by many Sikhs as
              cults. These include the Radhaswamis and the Namdhari movement.
              There was also the impact of the Kuka rebellion subsequent and
              corollary to the birth of the Namdharis. There was also the small
              matter of a resurgent religion expressing itself via the Singh
              Sabha movement, brought about in part by (and carried out as a
              part of) the backlash to the successful conversion of large
              sections of the general population to Christianity or Brahmo
              Samaj. Another factor was the founding of progressive Sikh
              institutions like the Khalsa Akhbar and the Chief Khalsa Diwan.
              The third factor was the revival of the Anand Karaj wedding
              ceremony, a practice which had mostly lapsed during the early part
              of the nineteenth century.
              <br />
              The 192 word Anand Marriage Act was passed by the Imperial Council
              in 1909. This act came about as the result of efforts by Tikka
              Ripudaman Singh (the then maharaja of Nabha, aka Sardar Gurcharan
              Singh), Namdhari Satguru Pratap Singh, and Sundar Singh Majithia,
              a knighted prominent zamindar of Amritsar. Both were members of
              the Imperial Legislative Council, at different times. For those
              interested in trivia, Sundar Singh Majithia was a direct ancestor
              of Harsimrat Kaur, wife of Sukhbir Singh Badal. Ripudaman Singh
              was a direct ancestor of Hemant Singh, Vasundhara Raje&apos;s
              husband and an erstwhile titular maharaja of Dholpur. Old money
              takes care of its own very well, and thereby grows into older
              money, as is pretty evident from the progress made by these
              dynasties.
              <br />
              But coming back to the Anand Marriage Act of 1909. It was an
              innocuous piece of legislation which arguably did not achieve
              anything at all except putting a meaningless stamp of government
              approval on the Anand wedding ceremony. It pertained to the
              wedding ceremony only, and did not aim to or pretend to define
              anew what could or could not be accepted as a valid marriage. It
              did not exclude other forms of wedding ceremonies, thus rendering
              the Anand wedding ceremony only one out of an unspecified number
              of acceptable ways of solemnising a wedding between Sikhs, or
              maintaining its status as one such way (depending upon which side
              of the acceptability argument you were on). Society was already
              approving all such marriages without demur. Moreover the concept
              of annulment of a duly or &apos;duly&apos; solemnised marriage was
              probably unheard of amongst Sikhs in those days. There was no
              attempt in this Act to define ways and means of getting divorce.
              There was no mention of any ramifications of a marriage between
              Sikh persons vis-à-vis their property or indeed any other portion
              of their lives.What then did this Act achieve? Was it an ego-trip
              for powerful politicians and rulers, designed to get their names
              into history books? Was it a first step or an early step towards
              carving out a separate identity of Sikhs? Did the
              &apos;leaders&apos; really feel that Sikhs would obtain any
              tangible benefits from a law enacted according to such a draft?
              Did Sikhs actually gain anything in the period when this Act was
              operational? Could they have not made such gains without this Act?
              A germane question in this context would be to ask if the Act did
              achieve something concrete, like for example foreshadow the
              Gurdwara Reform Movement of the 1920s?
              <br />A number of other questions can be asked here. Did not the
              Sikhs already have a prominent place in Indian society? Why then
              did they feel the need to lobby for a law which they felt would
              provide them their own separate identity or a pathway to such
              recognition? If they did feel the need to have a law, then why did
              they work for the passage of a Bill which neither defined what a
              valid marriage was (except to approve all marriages approved by
              society); nor who could marry and who could not marry according to
              these rites; nor indeed how such marriages could be dissolved if
              things came to such a pass?
              <br />
              Also, since there was no law pertaining to Hindu marriages,
              strictly speaking, why did they feel threatened that they would be
              subsumed by Hindu society if they did not have their own marriage
              law? Coming to section 3(b) &quot;Nothing in this Act shall apply
              to any marriage which has been judicially declared to be null and
              void&quot;, was there indeed even a single marriage which had been
              so declared? And if there was any such example of annulment of a
              marriage, surely the judiciary had declared it null and void on
              the basis of customary law (in the absence of any written
              statute)? Why then did they not attempt to have the imperialists
              lay down in black and white exactly what kind of marriages could
              or could not be declared null and void, and what kind of
              ceremonies were acceptable/unacceptable?
              <br />
              Moving to a time almost exactly a century later, we can see the
              Anand Marriage Act 2012. This Act has revived interest in the
              Anand Marriage Act of 1909, which was overshadowed by the Hindu
              Marriage Act in 1955 due to the inclusion of Sikhs as Hindus by
              the legislature of a free India. Resultantly all Sikh marriages
              were registered under HMA 1955. This led to confusion and
              difficulties in the recognition of Sikh marriages overseas. The
              2012 Act mandated registration of Sikh marriages under itself. The
              other thing which this Act did was to insert the phrase Anand
              Karaj in the statute. Would it be fair to say that this amended
              Act was passed with the limited purpose of ending the
              inconvenience faced by Sikh NRIs?
              <br />
              Interestingly Sikhs were represented in parliament in 1955 as well
              as in 2012, by MPs who could justifiably be called vociferous. Why
              did these members not take up the cause of broader legislation for
              Sikhs in terms of personal law? One of them was busy in television
              shows. Speaking as an equal gender rights activist, this writer
              would like to see some action to protect Sikh men from the
              pernicious provisions of dowry related legislation like section
              498a and 304b inter alia, knowing that dowry is expressly
              prohibited in Sikh tenets. If Muslim and Christian men can be made
              immune to the unfair provisions of IrBM in the forthcoming amended
              Hindu Marriage Act, then why not Sikhs?

              The Hindu Disposition of Property Act of 1916 permitted the
              creation of an interest of any specific person(s) who had not been
              born yet in the property owned by any Hindu person in India. The
              language used in the law is &quot;Subject to the limitations and
              provisions specified in this Act, no disposition of property by a
              Hindu, whether by transfer inter vivos or by will shall be invalid
              by reason only that any person for whose benefit it may have been
              made was not in existence at the date of such disposition&quot;.
              This lends itself to the meaning that persons envisaged in this
              Act include legal/artificial/juridical persons as well as
              real/natural persons. The limitations which have been mentioned
              can be seen in the Indian Succession Act (promulgated originally
              in 1865, and again in 1925, subsequent to this Act) and the
              Transfer of Property Act of 1882, amended in 1929.
              <br />
              The Madras Children Act of 1920 gave certain powers and
              obligations to parents in regard to their children. Parents of
              children with behavioural problems could now report their children
              as &apos;uncontrollable&apos; and have them admitted to government
              facilities. Parents were rendered liable for punishment if they
              put their children in immoral or dangerous surroundings or
              neglected them or incited them to indulge in anti-social
              activities. Similar Acts were passed in Bengal in 1922 and Bombay
              in 1924.
              <br />
              The Indian Succession Act of 1925 was an important set of laws for
              the Christian community, with certain parts being applicable to
              members of other religions also. The Act displayed progressive
              thinking and tried to advance the gains made through secular Acts
              like the Special Marriage Act of 1872; although there remained
              room to think or at the very least to argue that perhaps the
              imperialists were more concerned about the welfare of followers of
              their own religion –being the Christian religion– than adherents
              of Hinduism, Sikhism, Jainism, or other religions predominant in
              India. All followers of Indian religions were painted with one
              brush –an act which has led to a lot of heartburn in members of a
              number of communities, notably amongst Sikhs. There was however a
              separate section for Parsis or Zoroastrians.
              <br />
              The Indian Succession Act was a step in the direction of the Hindu
              Marriage Act of 1955, and a very big step towards the Hindu
              Succession Act of 1956, where it would be seen in slightly changed
              appearance.
              <br />
              The Act defined who could make a will and excluded lunatics or
              people who were not in their senses, but included all types of
              otherwise disabled people who were lucid in their thinking. It
              also enabled all Indian women to make wills regarding any and all
              properties which they were entitled to alienate during their own
              lifetime. It defined consanguinity in very detailed terms for the
              purpose of inheritance in the event of an intestate&apos;s death.
              It defined degrees of kindred and a method for computing them, and
              had separate sections on consanguinity by birth and as a
              consequence of marriage of self or others. It made it clear that
              persons who were similarly related to a deceased person would have
              to be treated similarly in the event of his or her death. These
              are principles which would be seen again and again over time in
              various laws, including in some small measure in the Hindu
              Marriage Act of 1955 and in close to facsimile form in the Hindu
              Succession Act of 1956.The Act also made provisions for succession
              in various permutations which could eventuate upon an
              intestate&apos;s death. It took care of situations where one or
              more out of the intestate&apos;s wife, parents, children, lineal
              descendants, lineal ascendants, brothers, sisters, in-laws, and
              natural successors of these categories of persons predeceased him
              or her. Veritable tables of precedence were laid down for various
              categories of people. It provided rules for attestation of wills.
              It also allowed revocation, alteration and revival of wills. It
              defined privileged wills and laid down the eligibility and the
              procedure for preparing such wills. It also laid down the law
              regarding executors of wills, as well as probate of wills.
              <br />
              The new law permitted ambiguity and errors in wills within limits
              and attempted to describe methods to remove and rectify errors and
              ambiguities, and to read a will correctly inspite of mistakes.
              However, this is not to say that the Act was silent on the
              drafting of wills. It had an entire chapter titled
              &quot;Construction of Wills&quot;, and made a valiant attempt to
              define what was acceptable and what was not acceptable in a will,
              for it to be good in law. This was done in rather elaborate terms,
              and the writers of the Act went to the trouble of providing
              numerous correct and incorrect examples.
              <br />
              Bequests could henceforth be lawfully made to entire classes of
              persons. Certain types of bequests were termed onerous, inasmuch
              as they imposed obligations on legatees. Other categories of
              bequests were also defined herein. Contingent bequests being such
              bequests as were to be effected only upon fulfilment of certain
              conditions or occurrence of events which were not guaranteed to
              occur. Such bequests were deemed to be legitimate. Conditional
              bequests differed from contingent bequests in that they were
              subject to conditions which could be fulfilled by the legatee
              depending upon the presence of a desire to do so. Void bequests
              were defined in more or less similar terms as the Indian
              Succession Act of 1865.
              <br />
              Bequests with directions as to enjoyment or applicability were
              also deemed legitimate unless and until such directions were not
              impossible to fulfil or immoral or illegal. Bequests to executors
              of wills were now onwards to be deemed to be legitimate only to
              the extent whereto the putative executor displayed an intention to
              actually execute the will as per the desire of the testator.
              Bequests specific and non-specific were defined in this Act and
              both were to be subject to the test of being acceptable as per
              other parts of the Act. Demonstrative legacies were defined as a
              specific sub-class of specific legacies. These were to be those
              legacies which were to be bequathed as a portion of specific
              elements of the estate of a deceased person.
              <br />
              The concept of ademption of bequests was clearly defined in very
              detailed terms. Ademption happens when a property bequeathed in a
              will is disposed of by the testator before his death. In such a
              situation the said property is said to have been adeemed and is
              not to be given to the pertinent legatee. Demonstrative legacies
              were excluded from the list of types of adeemable bequests. Such
              bequests were now onwards to be paid out of the general assets of
              the dead testator even if the specific asset out of which they
              were to be be paid were disposed of or liquidated. If liabilities
              were to arise out of bequests, they were to be accepted by
              legatees. Such legacies were going to be onerous as well as
              conditional.
              <br />
              Annuities were heretofore to be be paid only up till the death of
              the legatee, and not beyond unless specifically stated in a will.
              This was a clause which enabled a testator to preclude unintended
              consequences of any bequest.
              <br />
              The rights of the husband and the wife were made equal in the
              Indian Succession Act of 1925. No interest in each other&apos;s
              property was created by virtue of marriage, and both were to
              inherit each other&apos;s wealth in equal measure in the event of
              the other&apos;s death. The doctrine regarding domicile was laid
              down, and a person could only be governed by the laws of a single
              domicile henceforth. A married woman was deemed now onwards to
              have the domicile of her husband. This was a matter which would be
              re-examined in the future by the Law Commission and by competent
              legislatures.
              <br />
              Another point which would later be reviewed was the point wherein
              it was stated that any will made before a person got married would
              stand null and void upon his or her marriage. This included wills
              made in anticipation of marriage. There was also the confusion
              created by this Act in the sphere of privileged wills, as it
              created a genuine doubt in the mind of readers about the
              competence of Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Parsis, and others
              to make any sort of privileged will at all. Then there was the
              matter of the requirement for a letter of administration/
              administrative letter or certificate of succession for joint stock
              companies, which created impediments in smooth succession in the
              case of demise of kartas of Hindu undivided families.
              <br />
              There was also no specific bar against a murderer inheriting the
              property of his/her victim. This caused a lot of litigation with
              often conflicting end results. There was no provision about
              presumption as to who died first when two persons related to each
              other died together in any natural or manmade calamity. Many words
              and terms used in the Act were not defined satisfactorily, like
              for example the words dharma, punyadaan, punya-karya, dharmada,
              etc.

              <br />
              1) Create a society in which nobody wants to pay any amount more
              than what they are forced, trapped, seduced, or fooled into paying
              to anyone for anything. In which rich people have an incredible
              sense of entitlement (because only narcissists can hope to become
              rich), and poor people just don&apos;t matter to those in
              positions of influence.
              <br />
              Then sit back and watch general loot, cheating, and thuggery until
              some sort of revolution occurs. (Here it must be said that the
              revolution must be real and must be from within for the loot and
              cheating to stop in any given society.)
              <br />
              Our country is in this phase today, just like much of the rest of
              the world.
              <br />
              2) Enable an unenlightened set of people to become the ruling
              class in any society. OR let an oligarchy - kleptocracy assume a
              dominant role in a country. (It is the same thing said in two
              different ways.)
              <br />
              Then sit back and—
              <br />
              (a) Watch a ruling class –whose central goal is to perpetuate its
              status as the ruling class– enact laws designed to create endless
              internecine strife in the ruled class.
              <br />
              (b) Watch a ruling class which has too little imagination to see
              fairer ways of furthering its influence bring a country –and
              thereby itself– to ruin.
              <br />
              (c) Watch them create contrived and impossible bureaucratic
              procedures
              <br />
              (i) Which suck the lifeblood out of the ruled,
              <br />
              (ii) Which exist mainly to enable bribery and an artificial fear
              of future legal retribution, and
              <br />
              (iii) Which amount to nothing more in the end than a waste of
              national time and energy.
              <br />
              Our country has been in this phase for the entire period after
              independence, although the degree of oppression has reduced a bit
              of late. I reserve comment about the future.3) Take any type of
              relationship. It may be the vendor-buyer relationship, the
              teacher-student relationship, the business partner relationship,
              the donor-receiver relationship, the doctor-patient relationship,
              the lawyer-client relationship, the civil-military relationship,
              the police-public relationship, or any other.
              <br />
              Make a law which governs the said relationship.
              <br />
              Write in the law that whatever the first party gives to the second
              party (throughout the period for which the relationship lasts) is
              refundable to the first party in the event of the end of the
              relationship. And that whatever the second party gave to the first
              party will remain with the first party. In addition, specify that
              the second party will have to go to jail if he does not return
              what the first party gave to him OR if he demands back whatever he
              gave to the first party. On top of that specify in this law, that
              the second party shall pay a monthly amount AND a one-time lump
              sum to the first party in the event of the collapse of the
              relationship. Further specify in the law, that the first party
              will have the right to use the immovable property of the second
              party in the event of the collapse of the relationship. Add to
              your law that the second party and his near and dear ones will
              have to face criminal proceedings, should the first party decide
              to make any sort of allegations whatsoever with or without any
              sort of proof.
              <br />
              Then sit back and watch 20 to 95 percent of such relationships
              collapse. This number can vary, depending upon the level of shame
              (felt by the first party) associated with the collapse of the
              particular relationship, the inconvenience which the first party
              has to undergo in order to establish a newer relationship of the
              same type, the suffering undergone by people near and dear to the
              first party during the collapse and rebuilding of the
              relationship, and the amount of litigation that the first party
              has to organise and manage in order to get the benefit of the said
              law.
              <br />
              This, sadly, is the situation today in the husband wife
              relationship in India. This is why your wife has inflicted
              498a/406 on you and your parents.
              <br />
              As an aside it may be mentioned that this is applicable to any
              relationship-type except the parent-child relationship type. Even
              in this relationship, only parents will not take unfair advantage
              of such laws, but children will.
              <br />
              4) Make divorce profitable for wives, and costly for husbands.
              <br />
              Then sit back and watch the divorce rate zoom to the sky. If wives
              are rewarded only if they invoke criminal provisions against their
              husbands (or if the rewards come quicker in the event of a
              criminal case than otherwise), then watch the tide of false
              allegations which rushes in.
              <br />
              This is the situation in India today. This is why you are facing
              charges of cruelty related to dowry demand, and criminal
              misappropriation of stridhan etc.
              <br />
              5) Hold extensive consultations with representatives of
              prospective complainants while framing laws which are adversarial
              vis-a-vis two social groups, two genders, two caste groups, or two
              religious groups, but refuse to let the representatives of
              prospective accused into the consultation process. Let vested
              interests get a generous and broad hearing, to the complete and
              total exclusion of people who will be most affected by the law.
              <br />
              Then sit back and enjoy the spectacle of biased laws being enacted
              one after the other.
              <br />
              This is the situation in India today. This is why you and your
              parents are in the present predicament.
              <br />
              6) Make lawyers in-charge of framing and drafting laws. Give them
              a pre-eminent position in lawmaking. Don&apos;t examine their
              motives while they frame laws. Do not ask the question, &quot;Is
              this a deliberate attempt to create a law so biased that the
              affected party will have not choice but to litigate and litigate,
              thus benefitting that portion of the legal profession which is
              composed of successful lawyers?&quot;
              <br />
              Then sit back and watch laws which bring in a tidal wave of
              litigation get enacted.
              <br />
              This is the situation in India today. This is why you are
              suffering.
              <br />
              7) Give power to thieves who can only profit if there are very
              high taxes and lots of public expenditure on various types of
              projects –through kickbacks. OR if they get ridiculously high
              salaries paid by a public which is being taxed to death.
              <br />
              Then sit back and watch laws which favour various corrupt
              industrialists and businessmen enacted. Sit back and watch a great
              tide of tax and spend policies get framed. Get prepared to be
              taxed to death.
              <br />
              This has happened in India during the Congress raj and may
              continue under the present dispensation too. Wait and watch.
              <br />
              8) Combine (5) and (6). Let lawyers who usually represent
              prospective complainants drive the lawmaking process. Let feminazi
              lawyers rule.
              <br />
              Then watch the fireworks.

              <br />
              1) Do not lose your nerve. Stay healthy and start going for a walk
              in a park everyday even if you didn&apos;t do so earlier. If you
              cannot walk for long, go for a short walk. Just sit on a park
              bench if you don&apos;t feel like walking, and do some people
              watching. Don&apos;t smoke. At least if you have to smoke then
              don&apos;t inhale the smoke. If you feel that you do not have the
              emotional strength to work towards improving your physical health,
              then get help to improve your mental health, your mental strength.
              At any rate, even if you cannot improve your health, let it not
              deteriorate. Do not let your litigation push you over the edge of
              the crevasse into diabetes, obesity, blood pressure,
              chain-smoking, zero exercise, zero going out, drinking too much,
              depression, psychosis, etc.
              <br />
              2) Get support from whoever is willing to support you. You do not
              HAVE to be strong, but you do need a shoulder to cry on, this much
              is for sure. Try to find support from your friends and family. Is
              there anyone you can call any time and discuss your problem with?
              Surely there is someone? Then do so, and do it regularly.
              Don&apos;t show weakness in front of A2 and A3 (your parents!),
              and do not let them grow weak in spirit, mind or body.
              <br />
              3) Always remember that this too shall pass. Suicide is not a
              solution, and such a step will hurt the people who truly care
              about you. DO NOT refuse to seek help if you feel disturbed,
              confused, demoralised, or stressed out for more than 24 hours at a
              stretch. Get a glass of beer or a cigarette if you can and you
              must, but make sure to talk to somebody who you know cares about
              you. It can be anyone, not necessarily a parent or a member of the
              opposite sex.
              <br />
              4) Remember that most people you encounter in this fight –men and
              women– are sympathetic to you. Rejoice in this knowledge if you
              can, but derive solace from it at any rate.
              <br />
              5) If the litigation drags out over a long period, try to find
              female companionship if you can, but do it very very carefully, as
              the laws in our country are totally biased in favour of female
              accusers if the man they are accusing is not influential. Life
              gets very lonely without a woman to love you. As Indian men, the
              overwhelming majority of us are used to living without female
              companionship, and this is the way we have grown and spent our
              childhood, our younger days, and –unfortunately in the case of
              498a victims– an important portion of our youth also. However,
              this does not mean that we do not have the right to be happy.
              <br />
              Try to find happiness, and always be polite, but always remember
              that women do not like weak men. They may like poor men or ugly
              men or rude men, but not weak men. At the same time remember that
              the fact that you are going through a rough phase gives no right
              to –and is no reason for– any female companion, friend or lover to
              mistreat you.
              <br />
              6) Be bold. Play mind games with the aggressor. Watch her every
              move but do not let her think that you are doing so. Note
              everything. React at an appropriate time and place. Don&apos;t
              call the aggressor unless your lawyer advises you to do so. Ignore
              her totally as if she does not exist. Let her feel your total
              unconcern for her very existence. Never get provoked if she shouts
              or talks nonsense. Remember that passive mental disintegration can
              work very well on such women.
              <br />
              Good luck in your fight brother. You&apos;re the man. You may not
              see it, but this is your moment. Stay strong, and show them what
              you&apos;re made of. Maleness is indeed the acme of His Work.
              Reach it.

              Okay, this is slightly autobiographical. The health part appears
              late in the article.
              <br />
              Back in 1997, I was a fresher at Geoff Malone&apos;s main office
              in Singapore. Geoff was the founder of the Singapore International
              Film Festival, a collector of Saab cars, a member of the jet set,
              a friend of the Sultan of Brunei and his younger brother, and a
              multi-millionaire architect with two offices in Singapore, and one
              each in London, Melbourne, Sydney, Brunei and perhaps a couple of
              other places. The office where I initially worked was on the top
              floor of Orchard Towers at the top of Orchard Road.
              <br />
              It was the most sought out office in Singapore as far as young
              graduate architects were concerned, and the interior was more glam
              than major corporations like RSP or DP, or the oldest office in
              town –Swan and McLaren– all of which I had seen when I had visited
              them for interviews a few months prior to starting work. Their
              biggest source of income was from multiplex cinemas, which they
              were designing all over Asia.
              <br />
              Work was all I did in Singapore, and during my year there I never
              tried to visit Sentosa Beach or other major attractions which were
              not architectural in nature. In fact I did not realise during my
              time in the Lion City that Orchard Towers (which I often used to
              exit at around two in the morning) had many delights to offer.
              Such knowledge would have rendered needless that expedition to
              Hindu Road and the lane between Desker Road and Hindu Road in
              Little India one night, to unburden myself of a 27 year old
              weight. (That is if you don&apos;t count being on the receiving
              end of an older child unburdening himself when I was 3 or 4 years
              old, at the edge of Ring Road in Delhi, not far from the present
              day Nanakpura SPUWAC). I blame the writers of the Lonely Planet
              Singapore guidebook for this latter part; and my bookish outlook
              on the world.
              <br />
              Incidentally Little India was the seediest part of S&apos;pore,
              perhaps deliberately so. Chinatown on the other hand was very
              picturesque. I distinctly remember wondering less why I had to run
              from that transvestite when she/he/it tried to make me sodomize
              her/him/it after I mistook her/him/it for a woman, and more why
              this first and unpleasant experience had to be on a road called
              Hindu Road. Why could they not call it Lee Kuan Yew Street or
              Confucianist Street, for example? I also remember that the
              footpaths in Little India were extremely narrow, and hardly
              walkable unlike the rest of the city. Perhaps this had a role to
              play in the recent riot by South Asians in that area.
              <br />
              Geoff Malone International was very Singaporean, with ethnic
              Chinese workers competing for supremacy with white employees from
              UK and Australia; and Filipinos doing most of the draughting and
              whatever designing the mostly semi-competent white employees would
              let them do. I was the first Indian in the mix, and was a graduate
              of an elite school of architecture from Delhi. Although I was not
              competitive by the standards of my school (SPA), the Singaporean
              environment showed me that I was pretty good. Being good at your
              job does not always translate into being successful at it. Office
              politics was intense, and the glass ceiling was unbreakable. A
              menu for dissatisfaction.We used to consume a lot of stationery in
              that office, and the vertical blinds were not perfect. I had put
              up an empty carton of larger (or at any rate longer if not wider)
              than A-zero size paper / foam / block-board / something on the
              practically full height glazing behind my station to prevent
              reflected glare on my computer screen. Around this time there was
              some coverage of Arundhati Roy in some magazines, perhaps Asiaweek
              or (?) the Far Eastern Economic Review, or even Time or Newsweek.
              They all were published from S&apos;pore if I remember correctly.
              It was the early days of the internet and even hotmail was a new
              service, so there was no question of having access to Indian
              papers there. She had published her novel and it was all the rage
              in the literary world. I perhaps did not read it then, but I
              photocopied all those pages with Arundhati&apos;s photos on them
              and taped them to the carton behind me.
              <br />
              The redoubtable in some respects James DeSoyres –the lead
              architect on most of my projects– saw her pics and said something
              about her cuteness. I was simmering due to the discrimination, and
              was not very articulate. So I replied that she&apos;s not a cute
              girl, she is a senior architect. As an immediate afterthought I
              said that she&apos;s going to win the Booker Prize this year.
              <br />
              Let me explain the background here. Arundhati graduated from SPA
              six years before I joined it. She was cute, no doubt. In fact as
              late as 2006 one of her batchmates who was my teacher said that
              many of his batchmates had started to look like grandmothers by
              then, but Arundhati looked young. As far as the Booker prize goes,
              I knew that this was India&apos;s golden jubilee year so the jury
              would not be able to resist making a symbolic award. It was
              convenient / serendipitous that Arundhati released her book that
              year. It was eight years in the works, just like Joseph
              Heller&apos;s magnum opus, and structurally too it copied Catch
              22. Later on when I did try to read Arundhati&apos;s book, suffice
              it to say that I realised that it was not really unputdownable. If
              she is to be judged by that effort alone, then she is perhaps in
              the same class as Salman Rushdie –whose contrived prose is also
              certainly not top quality tunch maal– in my humble opinion.
              <br />
              This does not mean that I think that Arundhati is not a serious
              talent. Her auctorial oeuvre is fairly spread out, and she has a
              penchant for going out on a limb to create something. She wrote
              the movie &quot;In which Annie Gives it Those Ones&quot; (1989), a
              movie about life in a college of architecture. This was the first
              humorous and slightly exaggerated cinematic treatment of a small
              group&apos;s rigorous and demanding time spent in a top class
              professional degree college in India as far as I know. It came
              years before others thought of doing the same for colleges giving
              medical and engineering education. I am referring here to
              Munnabhai and the three idiots (no no, not Chetan, Aamir and
              Rajkumar). Incidentally Arundhati&apos;s movie also had one of
              today&apos;s superstars –Shahrukh Khan– in perhaps his earliest
              movie role, though he did not appear in the initial credits.
              <br />I remember that we first year students were making measured
              drawings in the early part of 1989, and went one night with many
              other students from SPA to Connaught Place and the neighbouring
              area. We went there mainly to see what we call Arundhati&apos;s
              movie. It was being screened at Max Mueller Bhawan. She must have
              been in the audience somewhere, and must have been happy to see
              the audience reaction. I was very satisfied with the movie at that
              age, and saw it a few more times later. It is conceptually
              interesting, extremely good for a first effort made with a low
              budget, and would not have remained a cult movie had architecture
              been as popular a field as engineering. Doordarshan merely gave
              her a late night slot if I am not mistaken, perhaps for this very
              reason. (It can be seen on youtube for free because she sold it to
              Doordarshan to make some money out of it, and DD doesn&apos;t
              care.)
              <br />
              It is to Arundhati&apos;s undoubted credit that she made a
              pioneering effort with this movie. Her extremely powerful first
              cousin Prannoy Roy used to sell his work to Doordarshan too, and
              later on was tried and acquitted for charges of corruption in this
              regard. But I am not sure if he has had any role to play in her
              success. Her mother said in a 2002 interview that she and her
              children were never contacted by her husband, who is/was also
              Prannoy&apos;s uncle, after they got divorced. Arundhati too has
              been in a short lived marriage like her mother. She was married to
              Gerard DaCunha, another alumnus of SPA who went on to achieve
              great success. He designed and executed nrityagram for Protima
              Bedi –with just one drawing, he told us. He created a powerfully
              expressive campus which is normally considered to be in the same
              league as Rukmini Devi Arundale&apos;s kalakshetra. Arundhati left
              him and later married Pradeep Kishen, a filmmaker. They worked on
              a few movies together, including the one mentioned above.
              <br />
              After the success of the God of Small Things, Arundhati bought a
              house in Chanakyapuri in Delhi and appeared to fade out. She
              reappeared on the scene with an article in Outlook when the Bomb
              was exploded by India in May 1998. I had come back from Singapore
              by then, and remember talking to my friend Valentino Chongthu the
              guitarist from SPA. He told me that everybody was very happy in
              the hostel with the nuclear test, and he had never seen so many
              people so happy together for so many days before. Valte was saying
              what everybody could see everywhere one went those few days. But
              wet blankets like Praful Bidwai and Arundhati wrote against the
              tests, and were covered extensively. Some people say that they
              were covered by the pro-Congress sections of the media, but she is
              pretty much everywhere.
              <br />I never bothered to read Arundhati after the self-defeating
              article she wrote against the nuclear tests, so I cannot tell how
              far she has managed to develop her craft. I met her once at Green
              Park market in Delhi. She was eating a Sambar Dosa in a
              restaurant, and one of my juniors from college was with her. I
              told her about my Singapore talk with DeSoyres. She just smiled a
              lot and said nothing if I remember correctly. Probably she had
              grown tired of attention from fans by this point.
              <br />
              By now you must be wondering what this has to do with your health.
              Read on and you will know.
              <br />
              The academic year in India starts after the summer vacation like
              almost all countries. Arundhati&apos;s unit had shot the movie in
              the summer of 1988, just before I entered the school as a fresher.
              The unit had organised a number of murals and graffiti. One
              message which comes to mind today was written on the urinal wall
              on the sixth and top storey. It said, &quot;Please do not throw
              cigarette butts in the urinals, they get all soggy and difficult
              to light up.&quot; This is gross and funny at the same time, but
              it gives an insight into the Indian system whereby you can buy one
              cigarette at one time, and even share it with friends. You cannot
              do this in every country, so you should be thankful that you are
              in India. Remember this and buy only one cigarette every time you
              walk to the local cigarette seller if your marital litigation has
              driven you to smoking.
              <br />
              Also, look at this sorted woman! She went from a privileged
              background to relative deprivation, but made all the right
              relationship decisions. She dumped –or distanced herself from–
              those who did not need her or those who suffocated her, and
              embraced those who needed her wholeheartedly. She had her mother
              before her as an example, and you can follow her example even if
              that involves you rejecting her. This is the key to keeping your
              mental health good, and as free adults you have the power to do
              this. She pursued success with the weapons which she had, and
              stopped chasing it after achieving it in reasonable measure.
              Marvellous, simply marvellous. You can do this in your career as
              well as your personal life. It will lead to happiness. I bet that
              Arundhati is a happy woman. You should emulate her and become a
              happy unit too.

              &quot;To love is wonderful, but being loved is what it&apos;s all
              about.&quot; The Floaters
              <br />
              &quot;The brighter the fires on the bridges behind you, the
              clearer the road ahead.&quot; Russian folk wisdom
              <br />
              Sometimes men are emotional fools and do not see what everybody
              else around them can see. Okay, let us modify this statement. Not
              just sometimes, but very often. This is even truer in the case of
              men who are married to narcissistic wives or are in relationships
              with narcissistic women. There are often very clear signs that a
              relationship is not working or that a marriage exists only on
              paper.
              <br />
              The fact that the man who is in the abusive relationship or
              marriage cannot see the abuse does not mean that the people around
              him cannot see it. There is, in fact, a common Russian saying that
              &quot;the view is clearer from the side&quot;.
              <br />
              However, very often, people who claim to be friends and
              well-wishers are not really friends and well-wishers, and do not
              wish to help such men. The argument that they do not wish to hurt
              these men does not wash, as these men are already being hurt by
              the women who they love the most.
              <br />
              Many men in such situations end their lives because no help is
              forthcoming from the people around them. This writer is making an
              attempt to list out some of these signs here, in the hope that
              some such men will search for a solution to their problem on the
              internet, and a few lives may be saved.
              <br />
              It may be noted that this writer has very strong views on love and
              mutual respect, and his standards may be stricter than a number of
              other people or types of people. In addition, it must be mentioned
              that this writer has had relationships, but children have never
              been in the mix, so he does not know much about those
              relationships where children are present. Nevertheless, these
              rules have helped this writer to get out of bad emotional
              situations, and he hopes that they may be of some help to you, the
              reader, too.
              <br />
              Also worth mentioning is that many points in this list are not
              surefire indicators of a finished marriage even in the
              writer&apos;s opinion. It has been attempted to indicate such
              points within the text of this article, although some may have
              escaped attention. The writer is not a qualified relationship
              advisor, and these are simply some of his personal views which may
              or may not be of real value.
              <br />
              1) She does not give you her highest consideration – It is an
              Indian cliché that business letters have traditionally been ended
              with the salutation &quot;assuring you of our highest
              consideration&quot;. In this writer&apos;s view, this is a
              necessary and sufficient condition for a marriage. If your wife
              does not put you in the first place, and gives more importance to
              other people or activities, then she is just having you along for
              your money or to please some people or to take revenge against you
              for some perceived emotional hurt.2) She does not live with you –
              If you wife does not live with you for an extended period of time
              on any grounds whatsoever, the marriage is finished. It does not
              matter whether she is visiting her parents, or working in another
              city, or is upset with you, or is away on a trip or a tour of duty
              in which her stated return date is either too distant for your
              comfort or keeps getting postponed. Being married means living
              together. Otherwise it is just a facade for a marriage.
              <br />
              3) You don&apos;t know how to behave with her to avoid offending
              her – There are many men who are in relationships or marriages
              where their &apos;girlfriends&apos; or &apos;wives&apos; keep them
              in a confused state or keep shouting at them or hurting them
              emotionally as a response to what is perfectly normal behaviour
              (like calling her and saying &quot;I love you&quot;). These are
              dead marriages, and men should get out of such relationships as
              soon as possible to be able to search for a better and healthy
              relationship or marriage.
              <br />
              4) You hesitate to call her or to talk to her for fear of being
              shouted at or being ignored – If you find yourself in a situation
              where you are not able to talk to your wife NOT BECAUSE she is not
              reachable, but because you are afraid that she will hurt you or
              shout at you or simply ignore you, then you are in a dead
              marriage.
              <br />
              5) She gives priority to her career over you – If your wife says
              that she is too busy to allocate time to be with you in a quantity
              which is sufficient to keep your need for attention and love
              satisfied, then staying any longer in such a marriage is dangerous
              for your happiness and mental health. Remember, YOU are the one
              who is entitled to decide how much attention and love and time
              together you need. It does not matter if she is a neurosurgeon in
              a metropolitan trauma unit or a chief minister. If your need for
              time together is not being met, then it is time to look for other
              options.
              <br />
              6) She has friends who you do not like at all – If your wife has
              one or more close friends who you do not like, and she keeps them
              in the face of your opposition, then it is a deal-breaker.
              <br />
              7) You suspect her – Remember, your happiness is in your mind, a
              calm and satisfied mind, and not in some debate about what is true
              and what is not. If you find yourself suspecting her actions and
              behaviour, then seek help from a professional psychiatrist. A good
              one will not take more than 15 minutes to tell you whether your
              suspicions reveal a mental problem or they are the normal
              conclusions of a healthy mind. If your psychiatrist tells you that
              your suspicions are not unreasonable, then it is time to call it a
              day with your wife, for the sake of your own sanity. Remember
              though that the psychiatrist will tell you that he cannot tell you
              what the truth about your wife is. But he can tell you whether
              your suspicions are the work of a healthy mind.
              <br />
              8) She keeps you out of her social circle – If your wife or
              girlfriend does not introduce you to her friends, or does not take
              you with her to meet her friends or relatives, or does not invite
              her relatives on your wedding or to meet you, then it would be
              correct to deduce that she suffers from some complexes. You are in
              an emotionally unsatisfying, dead marriage.
              <br />
              9) She insults you – The three strikes rule does not apply in this
              situation. If she treats you with contempt even once, show her the
              door, or walk out the door yourself. It is one thing to love and
              honour your wife, but if she insults you then she is not your
              wife, no matter what your passport says. You may also consider
              filing charges against her under section 504 of the Indian Penal
              Code (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the
              peace) if her insults turn into a pattern of behaviour. This
              section is also useful against trolls and online harassment after
              section 66a of the IT Act was rendered null and void by an SC
              judgment.
              <br />
              10) She ignores or avoids you – If your wife or girlfriend ignores
              you in social situations, or in any other setting; or if she
              avoids seeing you or meeting you, and there is no explanation
              which satisfies you, or there is no explanation forthcoming from
              her; AND this has happened a sufficient number of times to
              traumatise you (see point number 9 for a hint), then it is time to
              call it a day.
              <br />
              11) She does not pick up the phone or return your calls – If your
              wife or girlfriend (on a regular or a sustained basis OR for a
              number of times which is sufficient to put you in distress) does
              not pick up your phone, or she does not call back after you give
              her a couple of missed calls, and this is hurting you, then you
              are in an unhappy marriage –a dead marriage, in other words.
              <br />
              12) You are the one who is initiating all the interactions – If
              you are the one who keeps calling her, and she never calls you, or
              if you are the one who makes plans to be together, and she never
              does this, then you have to do a rethink about your future
              together.
              <br />
              13) You keep telling yourself that things will improve – If you
              keep telling yourself that things will improve if you persevere,
              and this is happening every day now for a long enough time to
              traumatise you, then it is time to pack up. Things will not
              improve, period.
              <br />
              14) You are the one who always apologises ­– If you are the one
              who has to apologise in all situations, regardless of whose fault
              it is, then you need to get out of this marriage.
              <br />
              15) Apologising is not in her dictionary – She says that she does
              not apologise. This writer&apos;s ex-wife once said, &quot;Agar
              main maafi maang loongi toh main apne baap ki beti nahin.&quot;
              (if I apologise then I am not my father&apos;s daughter.) If
              &apos;sorry&apos; is becoming a harder word for you to say than it
              used to be because of her refusal to reciprocate, you need to
              re-evaluate your decision to stay married to this woman.
              <br />
              16) The &quot;We&quot; has gone out of the relationship, or it
              never came into the relationship – She does not treat the two of
              you as one unit, or as equals.
              <br />
              17) I love her but I don&apos;t like her – If this is your
              situation, then you need to visit a psychiatrist AND to get out of
              this marriage.
              <br />
              18) I am waiting for the day when she will say that she loves me,
              then I will insult her – This is a fruitless and extremely painful
              pursuit. It is not good advice to tell you in such a situation to
              cut your losses and move on. Actually you need to urgently seek a
              psychiatrist&apos;s help in such a situation, get some emotional
              support, and THEN cut your losses and move on.
              <br />
              19) I have a girl on the side who lets me treat her the way I want
              to, but the woman who I call my wife/girlfriend is my main
              squeeze, though she treats me like sh** – You need help, immediate
              and urgent. You are playing with two lives here. Get out of the
              chain of pain immediately. The girl who you think you have on the
              side is the one who you can start to call your girl if you start
              treating her with respect. Your girlfriend is not your girlfriend.
              There is no main scene here, so there cannot be one on &quot;the
              side&quot;. Further, when you grow more evolved you will realise
              that there never is one on the side. Ask Prince Charles.
              <br />
              20) She is not there during your struggle – Your wife / girlfriend
              tells you that you need to become successful for her to start
              loving you or taking you seriously. Do an MGTOW on her and the
              rest of them, and come back when you have made it. Or find a woman
              who will love you as you are. Better a 5 who loves you than a 9
              who treats you like dirt. Or as sometimes happens, better a 7 who
              loves you (the 9 won&apos&quot;t, take it from me) than a 5 who
              treats you like dirt.
              <br />
              21) Your in-laws are not inviting you to their home – A genuine
              mother-in-law is like your own mother. Ditto for a genuine
              father-in-law. If your wife&apos;s parents are not inviting you to
              their home, you need to get the signal. IT IS A LOUD AND CLEAR
              SIGNAL FOR MOST OF US, BUT YOU CANNOT READ IT. HELLO, IS THERE
              ANYBODY IN THERE?
              <br />
              22) She has filed charges against you in court or with the police
              – Do not try to look for love in a situation where your wife is
              trying to hurt you financially, or to harass you legally, or to
              put you and/or your family in jail. If you see some hidden motive
              (including -but not limited to- a mistaken belief that she has a
              desire to punish you because she loves you) and not a genuine
              desire to hurt you in such actions from her side, then you need to
              visit a psychiatrist, urgently. This is indicative of Borderline
              Personality Disorder or worse. This is a complex topic which will
              be broached in another article on this site in due course.
              <br />
              23) She lies to you – If your wife lies to you in situations where
              such lies are not necessary to avoid hurting your feelings, then
              you need to stop calling her your wife.
              <br />
              24) She tells everybody or someone that she is single – Does she
              have a facebook &apos;single&apos; or &apos;its complicated&apos;
              status? Have you come to know from reliable sources that she told
              someone that she is single or separated from you, while you are
              still &apos;together&apos;?
              <br />
              25) The two of you are separated – If the two of you are
              separated, you might as well start the countdown to your divorce.
              Very few relationships or marriages survive separation in modern
              times. Very few. Yours is not one of them unless some people who
              you KNOW to be wise, and who you KNOW to be your well-wishers tell
              you (while giving compelling justification) that it is one of
              those marriages.
              <br />
              26) You have a long-distance marriage – It does not matter if you
              think that you have a long-distance marriage only temporarily.
              Also, it does not matter whether you are in different continents
              or different suburbs. Long distance does not work. To say that
              long-distance relationships work in a liberal society is like
              saying that cheating works.
              <br />
              27) She is in a glamorous field of employment and you are not, and
              she has got very little time for you – No no. No. No.
              <br />
              28) You are in a glamorous field of employment and she is not –
              See point 27 above. You don&apos;t need to tell this writer that
              you have got very little time for her.
              <br />
              29) She could see your income or your wealth in the matrimonial or
              dating website or newspaper or personal ad before she initiated
              contact with you, or agreed to your proposal, and your income or
              wealth as shown in that website or newspaper or personal ad was
              high, and you are very fat, and she is gorgeous – This is not an
              indicator of a dead marriage per se, but it is not a good
              beginning. Not good at all.
              <br />
              30) She knew you were very well off before she initiated contact
              with you, or agreed to your proposal, and you are very fat, and
              she is gorgeous – Much like point number 29 above.
              <br />
              31) You are very fat, and she is gorgeous – Not a healthy sign.
              See point 29 above. Actually this will not happen unless the
              condition which is mentioned in the title of point number 30 is
              also met in addition to the circumstances mentioned in the title
              of this point.
              <br />
              32) She says that if you don&apos;t hurt people, people will hurt
              you – If she says this, you need to move away from her, far away.
              If she does not say this but her actions reflect this belief, she
              is even more dangerous for your happiness / mental health.
              <br />
              33) She keeps you under her thumb – Even if you feel that such a
              situation is acceptable, just because she gives you pity sex
              sometimes, it is not. In fact, if you feel this way, then you need
              urgent psychiatric help. This is Stockholm Syndrome, an indicator
              of Self Defeating Personality Disorder.
              <br />
              34) She demands that you treat her with respect, while showing no
              respect for your feelings – Two can play this game. If she feels
              that she has the right to reject you even after having married
              you, you need to first develop the idea in your mind that you have
              the right to reject her if she does not meet your emotional and
              physical needs, and then implement this idea.
              <br />
              35) She says that she needs her space, or that she needs space,
              period – This is the atom bomb of relationships / marriages.
              <br />
              36) She accuses you of not respecting her boundaries – Then why is
              she with you? Even the existence of language such as this shows
              the desire to have a limited marriage –a thing which cannot exist
              in the particular space-time continuum where we are located. Such
              talk can be permitted at the stage of acquaintance, not after
              marriage.
              <br />
              37) She told you that she cheated on you – This is another atom
              bomb. Nothing can survive this.
              <br />
              38) You found out that she cheated on you – Unless your spouse is
              a President and you want to become Secretary of State at some
              point in the future, there is no need to accept such treatment.
              <br />
              39) You don&apos;t know where she works – This is not an
              acceptable situation. This is the end of your role as her husband.
              <br />
              40) You don&apos;t know her telephone number – Things should not
              have needed to reach this stage for you to wake up, but sh**
              happens sometimes. Now is a good time to opt out of this
              &apos;marriage&apos;.
              <br />
              41) You don&apos;t know where she lives – She moved out and you
              don&apos;t know where she lives? Apply for divorce immediately.
              <br />
              42) She calls and/or texts unknown persons – She calls and texts
              unknown persons, and/or receives communications from such persons.
              This writer&apos;s ex used to do half of this past midnight in
              their marital bed.
              <br />
              43) You haven&apos;t had sex for some time, and the reason is that
              she does not want to have sex, but she does not have a convincing
              reason why – Sex is essential for marriage. If you are both
              healthy and sex is not happening, you need to be satisfied by her
              explanation or to take measures to find a better situation.
              Don&apos;t wait for many weeks or months to make this decision.
              <br />
              44) She says that she enjoys hurting you – She says that she needs
              to keep you on your toes for you to love her. This is extreme
              narcissism.
              <br />
              45) You feel that she enjoys hurting you – You feel or suspect
              that she is using you as a target for her sadistic nature.
              <br />
              45) She says that she wants you to play &apos;patience&apos; – She
              says that you should leave her alone for some time and she will
              get back in the mood to love you. Refuse to play this game. Opting
              out is not incorrect here.
              <br />
              46) She says that you made the decision to spoil relations with
              her, and that there is no going back – The thing here is that
              going back is in her hands. If you are asking her to come back to
              normal, then all she has to do is agree to your request. Since she
              is saying that something which is entirely in her hands is
              actually not in her hands, you need to drop her. This goes beyond
              Narcissistic Personality Disorder into the realm of criminal
              behaviour.
              <br />
              47) She denies sex to get her way – This is a deal-breaker. Men
              can&apos;t live happy lives without good, unconditional, and
              plentiful sex. The whole marriage system and the global sex
              industry are based on this fact.
              <br />
              48) She says that the two of you have no connection – His ex once
              told this writer this thing. He nearly fell off the bed laughing.
              <br />
              49) She says that the two of you have nothing or very little in
              common – See point number 48.
              <br />
              50) She is unconcerned and/or hostile towards your parents - Walk
              out and/or kick her out.
              <br />
              51) She is very religious – Let her find happiness in divine love.
              <br />
              52) She says that she feels that sex is dirty and should only be
              engaged in to procreate She might be pretending to hate sex and
              actually be seeing another man. Also worth mentioning is the
              following quote made by Woody Allen once, &quot;Sex is not always
              dirty. Only if it&apos;s done right.&quot; &apos;Nuff said.
              <br />
              53) She cannot stay at home for even half a day – She needs to go
              shopping or to restaurants or to see movies every day. You married
              her without checking these things and now you cannot afford her.
              <br />
              54) She says &quot;Your money is my money, my money is my
              money&quot; – Get thee hence, you avaricious female canine!
              <br />
              55) You are apologizing but she is not willing to let bygones be
              bygones ­– This is not okay. Not okay at all. This is terrible.
              Pure vengeful behaviour which shows that there is a very high
              probability that it was she -and not you- who was responsible for
              the past fights.
              <br />
              56) It&apos;s all about her She has to be pleased, placated,
              invoked, invited, satisfied, satiated, propitiated. Your needs are
              not important at all. Get out of this marriage NOW.
              <br />
              57) She says let us meet other people She is already seeing
              somebody else if she says such a thing. She has already cuckolded
              you.
              <br />
              58) She asks &quot;What made you marry me?&quot; This means that
              she is actually asking you &quot;What can you tell me which I can
              hold against you in a court of law?&quot;
              <br />
              59) You feel that she is manipulating you – You feel that she
              plays games to get you to behave the way that she wants you to.
              <br />
              60) She says that she likes to flirt with other men OR actually
              does flirt with another man in front of you or somebody who is
              close to you – This is not done in a marriage. Her place is in a
              madhouse, not in a marriage.
              <br />
              61) She excludes you from her activities – If she does not let you
              participate in any activity in which you would like to be with
              her, the marriage risks becoming full of resentment. You may
              profess your faith in her to the world and even to yourself, but
              can you control all the primal fears and suspicions in the tiny
              crevices of your mind?
              <br />
              62) You have mixed emotions about her – You have very strong mixed
              emotions about her. &quot;You&apos;re not the only one with mixed
              emotions. You&apos;re not the only ship adrift on this
              ocean.&quot; Rolling Stones
              <br />
              63) Hard feelings – I hope this won&apos;t turn into a cut paste
              page for American bands. &quot;I&apos;ve got hard feelings. When
              it comes to you and me. And these hard feelings. Just won&apos;t
              let me be. These hard feelings run deep. These hard feelings run
              deep.&quot; Fleetwood Mac

              It happens to the best of us. Getting dumped is a rite of passage
              for some, and an all too familiar, uncomfortable &quot;oops, it
              happened again&quot; sensation for some. It can lead to feelings
              of &quot;Hey, good riddance&quot; in some people; while others may
              wallow in misery. A whole lot of us experience mixed emotions, and
              we hate &apos;our&apos; women for dumping us, and we miss them at
              the same time –wanting them back in our beds, wanting to hear them
              say sweet nothings while they melt in our arms again in our sweet
              imaginations. It takes a whole lot of time before we heal and are
              ready for a new relationship again. We feel that it is unfair that
              she got out of the relationship without any pain. A Cynical View
              of the Dynamics of Dumping/Being Dumped from the Male Perspective
              It sometimes happens that a Brad Pitt springs an Angelina Jolie on
              a Jennifer Aniston, and goes on to create a happy family, and the
              dumped wife continues to struggle for years, unable to find
              closure in her emotions, or suffering due to the public
              sympathy/sarcasm phenomenon. While the foregoing is a rare event,
              a Kim Kardashian doing a Kanye West on a Kris Humphries is a much
              more common thing, and can be seen everyday around us. The Devdas
              syndrome is a common theme in literature across the world, not
              just because most writers have historically come from the male
              gender, but also because it is something that we all see around us
              all the time. Do not take it personally. The battle is not you
              against your wife. The battle is you against all the men in the
              world who find your wife ****able. This is one of the ways in
              which the species works. It is a biological fact that a receptive
              female will find a host of male suitors ready to fertilise her and
              to compete with each other for the &apos;privilege&apos; or the
              pleasure to do so. Witness the tens of thousands of facebook likes
              which sexually suggestive pages featuring women rustle up in short
              order, especially in sexually suppressed countries like India. Men
              have a whole lot of spermatozoa, with new ones coming up everyday,
              and they can potentially fertilise several women even within the
              span of one day. The instinct and the need are very powerful.
              Women, on the other hand, have a limited store of eggs. On top of
              that –biologically speaking– they have to go through the pregnancy
              phase and the young child phase as a consequence of mating. She
              must mate with the best available male to make these phases as
              easy as possible. The judgement as to which male is the best
              available one is done by various females in various ways. Many of
              them choose the one who has the most females chasing after him.
              This is pure monkey-like imitative behaviour, called peer
              influence by some. Indeed many many females would prefer to spend
              a night of pleasure with a movie star than a year of stable
              companionship with a &apos;lesser&apos; man. The human species
              derives its impulses from many ancestors. In some species of
              primates it is fairly commonly seen that the female selects (or
              surrenders her sexual favours to) the strongest and the most
              dominant male, and that he has his choice of females, ready to
              please him sexually, and to bear his offspring for the successful
              continuation of the species. The weaker males –on the other hand–
              are often either unable to mate, or they are left with the less
              popular females. This can be seen in silverback gorillas, amongst
              whom the dominant male is a veritable ****-machine. He enjoys this
              until another male becomes stronger, and all the women go to that
              guy. There are other species amongst primates where the tribal
              nature of society makes a more egalitarian situation for the male,
              and practically every male gets to have one female. It is
              sometimes observed that the male kills or attacks his female if
              she strays from the straight and narrow. Therefore the female
              resorts to dissembling to hide her unfaithfulness. Note that she
              still plays around. This can be seen in chimpanzees. It is moot
              that the immediate availability of one or more members of the
              opposite sex is necessary to successfully dump the member of the
              opposite sex who is giving you a hard time, or to satisfy your
              sadistic instincts. Jealousy is a powerful emotion, and it is a
              futile effort to try to grow out of it. It is an emotion which is
              older than the very species to which you belong, and is hardwired
              into your DNA. It is a bonus for a dumper if the alternative
              lover/fool is more desirable than the dumpee, although this is not
              a necessary condition at all to ignite feelings of jealousy. As is
              usual in modern warfare, the first mover and the steadfast battler
              has an advantage. The female of the species is very often the
              first mover in finishing a relationship in this manner –bringing
              to mind Kipling&apos;s words:— &quot; So it comes that Man, the
              coward, when he gathers to confer With his fellow-braves in
              council, dare not leave a place for her Where, at war with Life
              and Conscience, he uplifts his erring hands To some God of
              Abstract Justice—which no woman understands.&quot; But Kipling is
              not totally pessimistic about the force of a man&apos;s manliness,
              and weighs the strengths of each side in this unwilled(?) war.
              &quot;And Man knows it! Knows, moreover, that the Woman that God
              gave him Must command but may not govern—shall enthral but not
              enslave him. And She knows, because She warns him, and Her
              instincts never fail, That the Female of Her Species is more
              deadly than the Male. &quot; Remember the song &quot;jhooth boley
              kauva kaatey&quot;? In the primitive exchange between the husband
              and the wife in that song, the wife spars with her husband, only
              to surrender to him when he threatens to bring a second wife to
              his home in her absence. Since that era 40 years ago a lot of
              water has flowed under the bridge, and womancipation in most
              countries has reached a point where a woman that attractive would
              reply that instead of her parents&apos; home she would head for
              Jamaica to have a good time alone or with a lover at Hedonism II.
              Speaking of swinging, the 21st century western version of
              civilisation has led to many perversions like the now popular
              cuckold fantasy genre in &apos;literature&apos;, cinema, and the
              internet. This type of man –essentially speaking– kills his soul
              because society does not allow him to control his woman now. There
              is also the social layer of money-madness which makes rich men
              irresistible to women in terms of being the preferred daytime
              companion. She may or may not deem the same man her favourite
              lover, depending upon the degree of selfishness in her
              personality. Like most people we meet and hear about, women do
              such things because they can do them, or –to be more accurate–
              because they can get away with them. It is also not your fault
              that you selected and mated with a female who was attractive
              enough to find another mate when she got fed up with you, or when
              she realised that she had a more desirable mate wanting to court
              her. You are biologically programmed to go after the most
              attractive female who is accessible to you, and the compulsions of
              modern society combine with her wiles to not let you seek out any
              other while she is with you. Moreover, your maleness has
              programmed you to chase, and she is programmed to entice. You may
              also feel –with some justification– that she left you not for
              someone more handsome or more successful, but for someone who is a
              sycophant and just says what she wants to hear instead of the
              truth. Well this writer has got six words for you –the truth does
              not always help you, and the spite/revenge package is very sweet
              for a larger percentage of humans than Jesus would have been
              comfortable with. The clever and merciless player does not always
              respond at the time of being insulted, and does not always protest
              that she/he has suffered a slight. He/she just hits back with ten
              times the emotional brutality at a time and place of his/her
              choosing. It is reflective of a criminal mentality, I know, but
              what to do? An Alternative, more Optimistic View of Being Dumped
              In the poem extract earlier on in this article, Kipling quite
              surely did not know that he was referring to what would come to be
              known as the personality disordered narcissistic female homo
              sapiens. Narcissists are often able to successfully hurt people on
              an emotional level, but their victims can take comfort in the fact
              that the narcissist can never be happy, never ever. It is
              axiomatic. Further, the narcissist does not usually attempt
              suicide at a young age, but a very very large percentage of this
              type ends her/his life himself after the age of 40. Their suicide
              attempts are much more lethal and likely to succeed than the
              suicide attempts of the borderline, the schizotypal, or the
              dependent personality type. It is also worth mentioning that a lot
              of such individuals meet a gruesome end at the hand of other
              members of society. This latter phenomenon occurs at all ages.
              This does not mean that you have to take up the responsibility of
              becoming the one who finishes off your narcissistic spouse. Give
              her a long rope to hang herself with. You might feel today that
              nobody gives a **** about you, but nobody really gives a ****
              about her either, strictly speaking. Also, did I say something
              above about a woman responding in kind to threats of being
              abandoned in favour of another woman? Well, I said that because
              threats are not very effective in these matters these days.
              Remember that jealousy cuts both ways, and equally strongly. You
              can make her miserable if that is your agenda (rightfully so, this
              writer may add). There are many ways to hurt her without making
              yourself a target for the police. You can succeed in such an
              effort to an extent where she will have you in her mind even if
              she is in bed with another man, even if he is the one for whom she
              left you. Getting another woman and timing the events related to
              such acquisition for maximum effect is one of the ways to achieve
              this. Another is to succeed in your career. Another is to become
              more attractive physically. Stopping caring about this woman is
              yet another way. Then there is the well timed verbal insult.
              Contempt. Humiliation. Ad nauseam. All these ways are more
              effective if they are used in combination with one another and
              with the right timing. Remember the song &apos;your time is gonna
              come&apos; if that is the sort of thing which convinces you,
              Thomas. A Word of Advice for the Man who has been Dumped
              Protesting has its place where a whole biologically vulnerable
              gender is either being victimised by laws like 498a, DV, or biased
              divorce laws or is sought to be put in an even more vulnerable
              position legally by an obsequious government and a glory-seeking
              judiciary. Social structures and norms which protect the rights of
              men are being dismantled nationally and globally, and it is
              correct to unite and struggle for justice. At a personal level,
              don&apos;t try to argue with the dumper. Logic will not work with
              her or with her family. Move on and continue your search. There
              are indeed plenty of fish in the ocean; and nothing succeeds like
              success; and there is no better revenge than success. Getting
              boots for yourself is important. It is easier than carpeting the
              whole world.

              The Public Information Officer (PIO),ID No. (For official use) RTI
              Cell, SPUWAC, Nanak Pura Delhi Name of Applicant — Manish Udar
              Address — House number 0123456, ABCD Colony, New Delhi - 1100xx
              Concerned Department — SPUWAC, Nanak Pura Subject - Application
              for seeking information under the Right to Information Act, 2005
              Background: 1) India is importing more gold than any other country
              in the world. Eighty billion dollars worth of gold was imported in
              the previous year. This is as much money as the net worth of the
              entire Tata business empire globally. This is more money than the
              amount which has been lost in all the scams since God knows when.
              Most of this gold is purchased by people on the occasion of
              weddings, or for their wife or daughter-in-law. 2) The national
              currency is spiralling downwards in the last couple of weeks. The
              news today is that it has gone down to 60 rupees to the dollar.
              Eighty billion dollars was worth four lakh thirty two thousand
              crores a few days back. Now it is worth 4 lakh eighty thousand
              crores. 3) Along with petroleum imports, gold import is the
              biggest reason for the current account deficit in India, and is
              causing inflation and other macroeconomic negativity. The Finance
              Minister has appealed to people to buy less gold, only a few days
              ago. 4) Buying gold for one&apos;s bride/daughter-in-law/wife is
              not a wise thing to do, as you in the CAW Cell are aware. Allowing
              her to bring gold at the time of wedding or afterwards is equally
              unwise. This is for the simple reason that the percentage of
              marriages which turn sour is increasing every year, and for
              daughters-in-law in our country it is as easy as buying a packet
              of samosas to register an FIR against her in-laws under section
              498a (cruelty for the purpose of getting dowry), section 406
              (misappropriation (by husband or his parents) of Streedhan
              (gold/dowry/gifts and property given by husband or his relatives
              to wife)), and section 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal
              Code. In total, these allegations are punishable by seven or eight
              years of hard labour in prison. 5) Even if a husband/groom&apos;s
              family makes a list of gifts exchanged at the time of wedding and
              gets it signed by witnesses, it is totally guaranteed that an FIR
              will be registered against them if the wife makes an allegation
              under the sections mentioned above. They will have to go through
              jail, bail, interrogation, police custody, judicial custody,
              endless rounds of police stations, courts lawyers, and prolonged
              mental torture. 6) The only way to avoid registration of an FIR
              under section 406 is to take or give no gifts (including gold) at
              the time of wedding, AND to get this fact recorded by witnesses.
              This also reduces the credibility of any allegations made under
              section 498a. Section 34 gets eliminated in the process. 7) So it
              is clear that buying gold for your bride, or letting her buy gold
              for herself, or letting her parents buy gold for her has a great
              potential to become the first step in your path to jail and bail,
              or just jail without bail, or police station plus lawyer&apos;s
              office plus court plus bail without jail. It is a thankless
              endeavour. Gold has led to a lot of misery in the lives of
              Indians, just as it did in the lives of North and South Americans,
              Africans, Australians, and indeed Indians over the course of
              history. 8) If Delhi Police uses a portion of its advertising
              budget to put out big advertisements in newspapers mentioning the
              facts listed from 1) to 7) above, it will do yeoman&apos;s service
              to the nation, will destroy the national hunger for gold, and will
              alleviate the misery of crores of women also. I am mentioning
              women here because claims regarding the misery of men do not
              appeal to our lawmakers and media, and are invariably discarded as
              lies. INFORMATION REQUIRED 1. Does the logic (or any sub-set or
              super-set thereof, or any intersecting set) mentioned in the
              &quot;background&quot; above appear valid to your department? 2. I
              state that the information sought does not fall within the
              restrictions contained in the Act and to the best of my knowledge
              it pertains to your office; and please give the information in

              Have you ever been in a relationship where you felt that you need
              to do your work and other activities first, and then organize to
              spend &quot;quality&quot; time with your partner? And he waited
              for you patiently or unwillingly every time or almost every time
              until the relationship collapsed. Is this a recurring pattern?
              Have you ever been in a relationship where your partner felt that
              he needed to do his work and other activities first, and then
              organize to spend &quot;quality&quot; time with you? And you
              waited for him patiently or unwillingly every time or almost every
              time until the relationship collapsed. Is this a recurring
              pattern? Have you ever been in a marriage where both you and your
              partner started out with clean intentions, but the marriage ended
              in a shambles? Is this a recurring pattern? Have you ever married
              a man with whom you were not ready to have kids at the very
              beginning of the marriage? Is this a recurring pattern? Have you
              ever been married to a man who was not ready to have kids with you
              at the very beginning of the marriage? Is this a recurring
              pattern? Have you even been in a relationship where you started
              out by calling your partner on the telephone sometimes, and he
              reciprocated the frequency (and perhaps the duration) of your
              telephone calls, but the relationship ended with a situation where
              one party was doing most of the calling, and the other party was
              ignoring the first party? Perhaps even elders or the police had to
              be called in? Is this a recurring pattern? Have you ever been in a
              relationship where you attempted to have a stable relationship
              with a man who was not in your town, was much more richer than you
              or of a very higher social status than you, or was socially not
              available, or mentally not prepared, to have a stable or
              long-lasting relationship with you? And the relationship did not
              complete you. Is this a recurring pattern? Have you ever been in a
              relationship with a man who was of a &quot;socially&quot; or
              economically unacceptable status to some people in your family,
              but you accepted him, only to reject him later, before the
              relationship could bear fruit? Is this a recurring pattern? Have
              you ever been in a relationship with a man when you were socially
              not available, or mentally not ready, to have a stable and
              long-lasting relationship with him? And the relationship ended in
              a shambles. Is this a recurring pattern?Are you currently in a
              relationship with any man who is not your husband? Has such a
              thing happened before? SECOND HALF OF THIS QUESTION IS OF CRITICAL
              IMPORTANCE. Have you never experienced a shortage of admirers?
              Simultaneously, has the desired man almost always been the one who
              said &quot;no&quot; or &quot;I am not sure&quot;, and sometimes
              kept on saying so for prolonged periods? MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION.
              THIS IS THE AFFIRMATION OF EVERYTHING I AM WRITING ABOUT HERE. Did
              you ever maintain or start or attempt to start a relationship with
              any second man when you had not declared to the first man that
              your relationship with him was finished for all practical
              purposes? Here the key is that it is not important whether the
              first man caught on to you or started suspecting you, but what is
              important is that you did not declare your intention to him before
              or after he started suspecting you or before you realised that he
              had caught on to you. Have you ever cuckolded one or both (or more
              than two) men, to put it in simpler language? IS THIS A RECURRING
              PATTERN, XXXXXX XXXXX? THIS IS EQUALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION
              Have you ever started or attempted to continue a relationship with
              a man after you had discovered, through intuition or logical
              reasoning or via a declaration made by him, that he was not ready
              to be with you forever, or that he had another simultaneous
              ongoing relationship? Has this been a recurring pattern over the
              years? I know that the person you respect the most, who is
              considered a human avatar of Lord (oldest deity) by some people in
              your circle (perhaps even by you), the man you and tens of
              thousands of people call Xxxxji, who is not on this planet
              anymore, said many times that &quot;If you can do something good
              for someone, do it. If you cannot do something good for someone,
              don&apos;t do it. But never harm anyone.&quot; In spite of the
              foregoing statement made by the man you admire most, are you
              unable to imagine yourself and your family in the same situation
              where I and my parents have been put by you? And you wish to do
              your best to see us locked up for many years if we don&apos;t give
              you 30 lakh rupees? You have no empathy for people who are
              socially closest to you or related to you? Is this a recurring
              pattern? Were you ever the victim of sexual abuse as a child? Did
              you ever have a relationship with a man who had been a victim of
              childhood sexual abuse? Were you ever in a situation for a
              prolonged period where one of your parents had an angry nature,
              and the other parent used to suffer? OR you had an absentee
              parent? Do you often feel that you need to keep yourself busy and
              occupied, right from waking up to falling asleep, failing which
              you would go bonkers? Do you often engage in at least one of the
              following? drive recklessly OR ask the driver to drive recklessly,
              engage in unsafe sex, abuse alcohol or drugs, binge eat, eat too
              little, indulge in shoplifting or extortion, gamble, or spend
              money recklessly. Do you sometimes get lost in your thoughts while
              talking to somebody? Does this happen more frequently when you are
              at the cusp of failure in a relationship? Do you often feel that
              you idealize others, especially when you first meet them, and you
              share your secrets with them. But then you feel later that these
              same people don&apos;t care enough and aren&apos;t there enough
              for you? I am not talking about just romantic relationships here.
              Is this change in attitude sometimes triggered by just one event?
              Are you sometimes very angry, extremely sarcastic or bitter, and
              feel that you have a hard time controlling your anger? Have you
              ever engaged in self-mutilating, self-harm, or suicidal
              behaviours, gestures or threats? Do you sometimes completely
              change your life goals or values or career focus? Are you often
              afraid that others will abandon or leave you? And you make frantic
              efforts to avoid this abandonment (even when it&apos;s not real)?
              Does your mood shift between extreme periods of anxiety,
              depression or irritability in just a few hours or days? Can your
              views of others -- especially those you care about -- shift
              dramatically and without any warning? Would you say that most of
              your romantic relationships have been very intense -- but not very
              stable? Are you currently experiencing problems impacting your
              ability to go to school, work, be with friends or family, or have
              a normal marriage or romantic relationship? Did you go through a
              period of turmoil when you decided to dump me? Was your suffering
              aggravated by my apparent nonchalance? Do you firmly believe that
              it is a cardinal mistake to say &quot;I love you&quot; to the man
              you are in a relationship with? OR Do you firmly believe that it
              is a cardinal mistake to say &quot;I love you&quot; to the man you
              are in a relationship with before he says &quot;I love you&quot;?
              Has your experience in romance validated the truth of this belief?
              Did you dump me because I was no longer a challenge for you? Did
              you marry me without trying to meet me a few times because you
              were afraid I would back out? Did you ever voluntarily make
              simultaneous attempts for arranged marriage and love marriage? Did
              you ever say to your partner that you need &quot;space&quot; or
              that you want to spend some time apart? Is this a recurring
              pattern? Do you often want to have the man who is most in-demand
              in a particular social circle, and want him to be yours
              exclusively? If the above questions have set many bells ringing in
              your mind, if this reads like the story of your life, you need
              medical help to help you achieve success in your next marriage.
              (note to reader: the prognosis for personality disorders is not
              good, and absurdly dismal in NPD and AsPD) Time to move on. The
              sooner you find an honest man willing to love you, the longer the
              happy phase of your life, and the older your children will be when
              you die. The beginning of your journey is entirely in your hands
              Xxxxxx, God willing. Stop trying to milk a dead animal which you
              have killed yourself. Grow up and save yourself thereby. Make two
              men and three families happy, as soon as legally possible, with
              some help from God. Wanting to be your ex-husband Assoc. Prof.

              What is the CAW Cell Process After a 498a Complaint is made by a

            <p className="flex justify-center ">
              When a 498a complaint is made by a genuinely aggrieved wife, or by
              a wife who is making a false complaint to extract money or to
              torture her in-laws, there is a procedure which is followed by the
              police. This procedure is based on the assumption that this is a
              dispute between a husband and wife, and that the state should try
              to not enter the space which is shared by husband and wife, and
              let them resolve their dispute between themselves. As is well
              known, the wife makes her complaint at one of the many CAW cells
              all over India. However, in this procedure, the party which does
              not want a compromise or settlement is put in the driving seat,
              and this party can drive the proceedings to a juddering halt and
              render them a complete waste of time. The wife is always given the
              first chance to play the spoilsport. The first step in the CAW
              cell process is the counselling of the wife on the day when she
              visits the cell with her complaint. They tell her her rights and
              limitations, and the rights and limitations of the husband, and
              the path that will be followed during the whole process. The wife
              gives her complaint in writing to the department at this point of
              time. The complaint is referred to the legal cell of the CAW cell.
              The legal cell goes through the complaint and makes its
              recommendations. Theoretically this opinion is regarding whether
              to proceed or not to proceed with the complaint, but nobody knows
              about any example where any complaint was not proceeded upon. So
              you can assume that the complaint will be proceeded upon by the
              CAW cell. However, if no offence is made out against one or more
              persons mentioned in the complaint, then those persons will either
              not be chargesheeted by the police at the women&apos;s police
              station / mahila thana, or they will be acquitted by the judge.
              After the legal cell makes its recommendations, the complaint is
              forwarded again to the DCP or JCP who is in-charge of the CAW
              cell. At this stage, an enquiry officer is appointed by the
              department, and this appointment comes directly from senior-most
              level in the CAW cell. The enquiry officer is usually a woman, and
              she is under instruction to have her sympathy for the wife (though
              this does not always happen). The enquiry officer is normally a
              senior officer not below inspector rank, with at least 20 years of
              experience. At the stage immediately after appointment, the
              enquiry officer meets the wife and her parents. She tells them
              again the whole process, and they tell her how they wish to
              proceed. The main court decisions which act as the basis for the
              work of CAW cells throughout the country are Joginder Kumar vs.
              State of UP (Crl. WP 9 of 1994) (Supreme Court), D.K. Basu (DK
              Bose –MU) vs. State of West Bengal (Supreme Court), Court on its
              Own Motion vs. CBI (Crl. Misc. 3875/2003) (Delhi High Court),
              Chander Bhan and Anr. vs. State (Bail application 1627/2008)
              (Delhi High Court, Kailash Gambhir J.), and most recently Arnesh
              Kumar vs. State of Bihar. All theses decisions prompted DGPs of
              various states of issues guidelines. Delhi was one of the first to
              do so, and former police commissioner Yudhbir Singh Dadwal&apos;s
              standing order no. 330/2008, issued in this behalf, can be
              downloaded here (external resource). An excellent resource
              exploring the legality / illegality of CAW Cell Delhi and/or its
              actions is available at this webpage (external resource). The
              enquiry officer writes a summons which is sent to the wife and the
              husband by the immediate senior of the enquiry officer. The
              immediate senior of the enquiry officer is usually an ACP, who is
              (again usually) a woman, and she also has been told to keep her
              sympathies with the wife. The whole CAW cell is mandated to be
              biased in favour of the wife. The summons is hand delivered by an
              employee of the department to the house of the husband and the
              wife on the same day. This is the first time when the husband
              learns that he is an accused in a 498a case. They are requested to
              come to the CAW cell, but do not think of this as a request. This
              is a legal document which must be obeyed. If the husband ignores
              this summons then he may have problems in getting anticipatory
              bail. There is no right or wrong stage for applying for
              anticipatory bail in 498a/dowry cases. It all depends upon how
              inexperienced and afraid you are and how much money you are
              willing to spend on lawyers in your matrimonial conflict.On the
              day of the first meeting with the enquiry officer, the husband and
              wife are made to sit together and they tell their versions. They
              make allegations and counter-allegations. At the end of the
              session, the enquiry officer asks the wife what she wants now. The
              wife says she wants conciliation (to live together again after
              counselling by a counsellor). Or she may say that she wants
              mediation (to decide the terms and conditions of mutual consent
              divorce, including full and final monetary settlement). She then
              asks the husband what he wants and tells him that if he refuses to
              listen to the wife then he may encounter difficulties in getting
              AB. The enquiry officer makes notes in her file and makes the
              spouses sign their attendance. Then she takes them to her
              immediate superior. The immediate superior listens to the enquiry
              officer and believes her completely. Then she talks to the wife
              and last of all to the husband. The husband and wife are told to
              go to the conciliation cell and they meet the clerk there and ask
              for an appointment. They are told to come back after a week. When
              they come back on the appointed day, the appointed counsellor
              meets wife and husband and tells the husband to wait outside while
              she talks with the wife. The wife narrates her version and makes
              her demands, usually separate residence from parents or some other
              demand. She is also asked whether she wants conciliation or not.
              This is done inspite of the fact that it was the wife who had
              asked for the conciliation proceedings. Then the husband is called
              and he narrates his version and makes his statement about whether
              he wants conciliation or not. Then both the spouses are called
              together and they are told the result of the conciliation.
              Sometimes another date is given, sometimes they are advised to
              seek mutual consent divorce. If another date is given then they
              come again for as many times as the counsellor considers necessary
              and fruitful. If another date is not given then the counsellor
              takes in writing from one or both spouses that they do not want
              further attempts at conciliation. Then they go to the enquiry
              officer, who calls them on another day after one week, or a longer
              time if one of the parties is from another town. The next time
              they come, they are asked one by one whether they want mediation.
              If the wife says yes then the husband has to agree, or he
              &quot;may have difficulty in getting anticipatory bail&quot;
              (according to the EO). Then the enquiry officer gives the list of
              stridhan items which are claimed by the wife to be with the
              husband. Then the husband comes back after a few days with the
              admit list, which is the list of items that he admits is with him.
              After this list is submitted, they are directed to go to the
              mediation cell. There, the clerk gives them a date for the
              audio-visual presentation about the mediation process. The
              audio-visual presentation is held in the central CAW cell, also
              known as the SPUWAC of the city. SPUWAC means Special Police Unit
              for Women And Children. In Delhi it is at Nanakpura. On the day of
              the audio-visual presentation, about 50-200 couples from all over
              the city come to the SPUWAC, and a high court lawyer makes the
              presentation, which is about 3 hours long. It is just a waste of
              time and public money to spend 3 hours on a presentation which is
              not really a presentation but a long session of group counselling
              in disguise. If they announce it as counselling in advance, then
              people will pay more attention instead of walking out in the
              middle. The only solid information they give in this session is
              that there will be a maximum of five mediation sessions, and that
              a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is to be made at the end of
              mediation, if the mediation is successful. They are also told that
              this cell manages to end more than 3 out of 5 disputes without the
              need to use further legal options. This is a little bit out of the
              ordinary, because 498a is a cognisable crime, and an FIR is
              mandatory upon filing of a complaint in such an offence. Some
              courts and legal commentators have said that the police should
              first file an FIR, and then conduct mediation proceedings, but it
              seems that wiser counsel has prevailed, because once an FIR is
              filed then the case cannot be quashed without a wait of at least
              about 18-24 months. Or possibly the ideators of quick and
              successful legal blackmail have prevailed. After the audio-visual
              presentation, a date is given for the first mediation session. On
              this day, the mediator, who is a high court lawyer, and who is not
              a high court employee but a police consultant, conducts a
              mediation session with both husband and wife first. Then with the
              wife alone, in which she asks her how much she wants and how much
              she is willing to go down. Then she talks to the husband alone,
              and asks him about his offer and paying capacity. Finally she
              talks to husband and wife both, and in this dialogue they find out
              if they have been able to reach an agreed amount. She gives a next
              date at the end of the session, which is a bargaining session for
              full and final settlement, just like the first session. Like this
              five sessions maximum are held, with minimum being one session. At
              the end, if there is an agreement, then a MoU is prepared.
              Otherwise, husband and wife are told to go home. At this stage,
              the enquiry officer sends a written notice to both husband and
              wife to appear before her. On the appointed day, they appear
              before her, and she listens to their narrations. Then she asks
              them again if they want conciliation or if the husband is willing
              to accept the wife&apos;s demand or the wife is willing to accept
              her husband&apos;s offer. If there is no agreement, then she asks
              the husband to bring a copy of any anticipatory bail order from a
              competent court that he may have obtained so far (although he is
              not required to do so by law), and asks the wife to bring copies
              of receipts of marriage expenditure, photos of the wedding, and a
              copy of the wedding invitation. Then they both come after a week
              with the required documents and they are asked again the same
              questions as last time. If their answer is no, then the enquiry
              officer forwards the file to her immediate senior, who forwards it
              to the DCP or JCP in-charge, who forwards it to the police station
              near the wife&apos;s home (or near the main CAW cell of the city,
              if the complaint was filed at that cell by the wife) for
              conversion to an FIR.

              The women&apos;s police station which is attached to the SPUWAC
              Nanakpura, which is the main CAW Cell in Delhi, is a place which
              is worth visiting for every person who might want to learn about
              the truth behind the claims being made by Delhi Police and the
              rest of the law enforcement machinery in the national capital.
              Government officers keeps saying that crores have been spent in
              modernisation and training of the police. Is this a statement of
              fact? I remember seeing only one computer in the whole police
              station. This is the computer at the reception. Investigating
              officers do all their work by hand. Those who are from an older
              generation have not been provided any training by their
              department, which has a number of training establishments, and has
              appointed a director general level officer as the man incharge of
              training. What this director general has achieved in terms of
              making these IOs computer literate is there for everyone to see.
              One man in one of the rooms occupied by the IOs laughs when I tell
              him to requisition computers for himself and his colleagues, and
              tells me that I cannot start to imagine even the ABC of police
              administration. I see a steel almirah standing in the sun, with
              clear signs of peeling paint and rust. An IO tells me that this is
              a part of stridhan/dowry which was recovered from a husband&apos;s
              home and brought to the police station, but the wife has not taken
              it back yet. There is a water cooler for drinking water, but it is
              situated along the boundary wall at the edge of the lawn at the
              front, and is slowly rusting to oblivion. There is a glass at the
              tap of the water cooler, but nobody uses it, wisely. I go to meet
              the IO allotted to me. There are two chairs for his visitors in
              front of his table. They are tied to one of the legs of his table
              by iron chains which are held fast by an ingeniously placed lock
              for some unclear reason. This is psychologically disturbing for
              me, but I let it slide and do not complain to anyone. After all I
              am the main accused, and I have few real rights in the Indian
              legal system. There is a decrepit room with a low door near my IOs
              room. The door to that room is old and broken, and somebody has
              shoddily painted the words &quot;toilet out of use&quot; in black
              paint at the top of the door frame. There is a pair of functional
              toilets around the back of the police station to which all men and
              women go. I note as an urban designer that these toilets are in an
              unmonitored and a negative space, and the lady officers who use
              the ladies toilet run the risk of getting mugged by any of the
              real criminals who constitute a small percentage of the accused
              persons by their own estimates.The SHO sits in a cabin which is
              separate from the whole police station, in the sense that you have
              to go out of the main door of the thana, and then walk a few yards
              to reach the SHOs cabin. The SHO sits behind a glass door. She is
              observable by all her subordinates who may stand outside to catch
              some fresh air, but she cannot see any of her subordinates from
              her seat, or from any point in her office. She has to walk out
              into the cold or rain or sun, and then walk to the reception, and
              then go to the various rooms where the subordinates are sitting.
              There is no intercom system for her to call them. It is all done
              on mobile phone or by walking to the reception and sending
              somebody from there. One day I see her berating the subordinates
              at the reception for their incompetence and laziness. This is not
              surprising because there is more than one person sitting at the
              reception who gives unasked for advice to accused / defendants,
              and they are generally too busy talking to each other to care
              about the visitors. There is an ACP or an Inspector (I forget her
              rank) who sits in a room in a building at the back of the police
              station compound. This is in keeping with the theme of making
              people walk out of the main door to go to various parts of the
              police station. I gather that she either makes decisions in the
              absence of the SHO, or she is mandated with vetting the SHOs
              decisions. She is very gentle and obsequious with the complainant
              women, and calls them beta/beti. She does not bother to offer a
              chair to a septuagenarian accused mother-in-law. There are 15
              investigating officers in this thana. This is one of the largest
              number of IOs in any police station in the country. They are often
              seen complaining that they have to keep running from one court to
              another every day. One investigating officer told me that judges
              are an angry and unreasonable lot, and they often issue
              non-bailable warrants against investigating officers who fail to
              turn up on even one court date. He went to the High Court one day
              ago, knowingly ignoring the date at a lower court on the same day.
              The judge gave an earful to the public prosecutor who in turn told
              the IO off. He has not been here as long as most of the others,
              but he says that he has more than 50 cases to handle, and a new
              one comes almost every day. If every case were to be converted to
              an FIR, then these investigating officers would go mad because of
              the workload. As it is, things are not rosy for them, with public
              prosecutors berating them for shoddy work, the SHO pressuring them
              to perform, and the judges issuing non-bailable warrants against
              them. So these men try to arrange compromises between complaining
              wives and husbands. This way they save a big headache for
              themselves and the system. There are innumerable people who will
              agree with the observation that if all the cases which end in
              monetary settlement before the FIR stage were to be converted into
              FIRs, then the crime against women rate recorded by the National
              Crime Records Bureau would go up by a factor of three and a half.
              Such a situation would result in more funds for the CAW Cell, and
              more power to the police to harass husbands, and (more&apos;s the
              joy) the feminists (the only people who matter these days) would
              feel vindicated. (The judiciary or the government –it is not clear
              which– is not keen on letting the already collapsed criminal
              justice system sink into the ground further. Ergo, the compromise
              formula has been devised. This keeps the wives and their parents
              happy too.) But a closer look reveals that this logic is faulty.
              The monetary compensation system is also the reason why there are
              so many complaints. Indeed, if you make rape compoundable on
              payment of money, you will see the rape rate shoot up to a level
              at least 5 times higher than it has shot up already –after women
              all over the country realised (in the wake of the famous rape
              case) that they can destroy any man who they hate and still remain
              anonymous if they make a rape complaint against him. One of the
              IOs sees me arrive five minutes before time, and comments that I
              have done a wise thing. I have no idea what he is talking about.
              He tells me that while leaving also I should make sure that I do
              not leave with my &apos;wife&apos; and her father, and the penny
              drops. He says that there are no laws in favour of men anywhere in
              the world, not just in India. I tell him that the discrimination
              against men is not just limited to written laws, but is being
              perpetuated by publicity hungry members of the judiciary too. He
              agrees with me. (A note to the reader: In a recent acquittal of a
              rape accused by a two judge bench, the judges noted that the man
              had clearly been falsely accused. They made some observations in
              their judgement about rape being a crime which destroys the very
              soul of a woman. Would it not make more sense if they were to wax
              lyrical about the atrocity caused by false accusations of rape
              (and not by rape) when they were writing a judgement about a false
              accusation? Is it not sufficient for them that the whole
              legislature, executive, and the media complex of the world is
              currently engaged in demanding justice and &apos;justice&apos; for
              women? Why did they feel the need to add their two cents in a
              place where it is not apposite to the context? Does this not
              reveal a desire for self-publicity? A desire to be lionised by the
              media which is obsessed with female victims and
              &apos;victims&apos;?) The SHO talks to me for five minutes, having
              talked to my &apos;wife&apos; and her father for about 30 minutes.
              She makes some comments about them and their character which I
              cannot reveal here.

            <p className="flex justify-center ">
              The first time that I had occasion to visit the Delhi High Court
              was back in 2004 or 2005. I had learnt about the power of the law
              not too long ago, and I had decided to file a writ petition to
              resolve an issue of international importance. I used to think that
              the phrase &apos;writ petition&apos; means the same thing as a
              petition. I was surprised to learn that writ petitions are a
              separate class of suits, and that they are filed directly in the
              high courts without having to go through lower tiers of courts. I
              engaged a senior lawyer, an advocate-on-record in the Supreme
              Court. One thing about a writ petition is that you can file it but
              you cannot be sure of getting a hearing until they admit your
              petition. The lawyer&apos;s office called me a couple of days
              before the hearing for admission of the petition. The lawyer
              in-charge of my case had a discussion with me and then told me to
              take a slip from the peon on which there was the firm&apos;s
              stamp, and the signature of one of the firm&apos;s officers. I had
              to fill out this slip in order to be able to enter the premises of
              the high court. I reached the Delhi High Court on the day of the
              hearing and found a parking spot in the lawyers&apos; parking
              opposite the court. I crossed the road and stood in a queue to get
              an admission slip in exchange for the slip which I had received
              from the lawyer&apos;s office. I got the admission slip and
              entered the court complex. There was a queue of people at the
              entrance of the court building, and people were handing over their
              mobile phones to a man who was pasting stickers with numbers to
              the backs of the phones and putting them in a rack. I gave my
              mobile phone to him and entered the building. For people who do
              not know anything about courts at all, Delhi High Court –just like
              most other courts– is not one court, but it is a collection of
              many courtrooms. There are a number of judges and each judge is
              given one courtroom for his whole tenure in the court, unless he
              gets promoted to Chief Justice, in which case he gets the biggest
              courtroom in the building. Sometimes there is a bench of judges
              which hears a petition, which might consist of two to nine judges.
              There is something called a full court, which includes all the
              judges in the court, but this is not a bench. A full bench is any
              bench which consists of three or more judges. All the judges in a
              bench go and sit in the court of the seniormost judge in the bench
              on the days of hearings. Perhaps the reason for a high number of
              vacancies for judges in our high courts is that there are not
              enough courtrooms for them. The lawyer in-charge of my case had
              told me that Gita Mittal would be the judge for my case, and had
              told me the court number where she would be sitting. I found out
              that this court was on the first floor and I went to the lobby on
              that floor and waited. The senior lawyer came and I greeted him.
              He was busy with other senior lawyers so I thought it better not
              to disturb him with my chit-chat. When the judge came to the court
              we entered the court. Later on I came to learn that we can enter
              the courtroom even before the judge comes to her chair, but
              everybody should stand up when the judge comes, and should sit
              down quietly when she sits down. But this does not happen in
              reality. All the people in the seats for the lawyers and the
              public keep talking endlessly amongst each other. There is also a
              massive racket due to the two to five hundred people who are
              chatting in the lobby on each floor. The courtroom has a single
              door, and people keep coming in and going out all the time. The
              racket from the lobby disturbs all the people who are sitting in
              the back of the courtroom, and they cannot hear what the judge and
              the lawyer are saying. In smaller courtrooms there are only two or
              three rows of chairs, and your lawyer stands very near the door
              when he argues the case, and the noise from the lobby must be
              disturbing him while he is trying to listen to the judge who is
              seated far away without a microphone.The judge also speaks in a
              very soft voice when he announces his order or decision, and it is
              difficult to hear him at the back. The judge speaks softly because
              he thinks that he is basically dictating the decision to the
              typist, who is not far from him. But the voice of justice should
              be loud in my opinion, or in my humble opinion as the lawyers in
              this –and other courts in our country like to say (more about the
              humbleness of lawyers further on in this article). The courtroom
              is full of papers and wood and computers with battery powered
              backup, and is a potential firetrap. The only door for the public
              swings inward, which is a ridiculous thing in a public room with
              only one door, and can be dangerous in the event of a fire.
              Interestingly, I had occasion to visit Delhi High Court again in
              2012-13, and was amazed to see that the same problems existed in
              the new court block which had been erected to accommodate the
              growing number of litigants. There was also the small matter of
              the booths for visitor&apos;s passes being located right on the
              road, where anybody could place a bomb. This did happen, as
              everyone knows. (I do not remember whether I noticed this back in
              2005 or not, but I did notice in those days that the first
              frisking cum security check for a person flying out of Indira
              Gandhi Airport took place after the person was already more than a
              quarter of a kilometre inside the building.) I cannot help
              noticing these things because of my training as an architect, and
              am wondering at the genius who designed this building. He managed
              to win the commission for designing this building, which is any
              day a tougher job than designing a building in our country, but he
              failed to design a functional building. (Although I am impressed
              by the exterior massing and treatment of the main building of this
              court, which is architecturally much more satisfying for me any
              day than the Supreme Court building. This is inter alia because
              the visual memory that remains in my mind after having visited
              this building a few times is one which proclaims the equality –at
              an exalted level– of all petitioners before law, while the SC
              building which remains in my mind reminds of the power of the
              court itself, or of judges who work there. This building speaks to
              me of justice, the SC building speaks of the law.) Also I am
              thinking that there are probably at least 500 geniuses in this
              court on any given day, and they have not been able to solve such
              a simple problem. A simple vestibule cum double door at the
              entrance to every courtroom would solve the noise problem.
              Covering the walls of the lobby with sound absorbent material like
              cork sheets or other similar perforated materials would reduce the
              problem even further. In fact, if I remember correctly, the walls
              of some of the individual courtrooms have acoustic material on
              them, which deadens the already soft voice of the judge, and of
              the lawyers too. Further, it adds to the fire risk if it is not at
              least partially composed of gypsum. The judge sits on a large
              chair with a high back and an Ashok Chakra at the peaked centre of
              this back. She is situated behind a large wooden platform cum
              fitted table which can commonly be seen in movies, and does not
              need to be described here. What you don&apos;t always see in the
              movies is that there are a number of court employees like typists
              and clerks who sit in a space in front of the judge which is
              blocked off from the space where the public and the lawyers sit.
              One or two employees sit to the side of the judge also. The space
              occupied by the judge and court employees amounts to more than
              half the area of the courtroom in some courtrooms. In larger
              courtrooms also it takes up a significant portion of the total
              area. The lawyers stand in front of the barrier at the edge of the
              space for the employees, and ahead of the first row of the public
              seating. There is a narrow table with two small tables on top of
              it. The lawyer for the government stands in front of the small
              table on the left side of the narrow table, and puts his files on
              this small table and to its side. The petitioner&apos;s lawyer
              stands on the right side of the narrow table –in front of the
              other small table. There can be a number of respondents, and each
              respondent can send one or more lawyers to the court. The
              petitioners can also be many, and each of them can send one or
              more lawyers. So there can be a number of lawyers in the court for
              just one case. Whichever lawyer wishes to speak must step in front
              of the small table while his comrades listen and observe while
              waiting to interject at an opportune time. The lawyers start their
              arguments and I can see that some of them are well-known persons.
              They address the judge (even lady judges) as &apos;lordship&apos;,
              which is demeaning to the lawyers and the petitioners in addition
              to being incorrect. And they don&apos;t just call her
              &apos;lordship&apos; once, and leave it at that. They go on at it
              continuously, and the words that are ringing in my ear as I leave
              the court are &apos;lordship lordship lordship lordship
              lordship&apos;. I had occasion to visit the courtrooms of
              Vikramajit Sen, Anil Kumar, and P.K. Bhasin at the high court, in
              addition to Gita Mittal, and it was the same story in all the
              courtrooms. Pathetic. Some lawyers use &apos;me lord&apos; or
              &apos;milord&apos; instead of lordship. This particular word has
              sarcastic connotations, but I am not sure that all the users of
              this form of address know this fact. Gita Mittal did not force an
              old lady who was arguing her own case to address her as lordship.
              There is or used to be one judge in Delhi High Court who used to
              request lawyers not to address him as &apos;lordship&apos;, and
              you could see this request on his cause list every day on the net.
              Anyway, to cut a long story short I got notice bail from Delhi
              High Court in my 498a case. The public prosecutor did not even
              oppose our application. Probably he got dazzled by the professor
              and doctor titles in the joint application. I have reason to doubt
              that the judge even bothered to read our application carefully or
              maybe even at all. The morons were calling the enquiry officer on
              the phone (this was in 2012-13, and by this time there was no need
              to deposit mobile phones at a counter) when we were walking out,
              and telling her that they are on their way to the court.

              Michael is a very close friend of mine in New Zealand. He is half
              Irish or Scottish (I forget which) and half Maori. He has a short
              physique, and in his younger days he used to be very slim. Now he
              is in his 50s, for those curious. His physique was ideal for the
              job of a horseracing jockey, and he used to race horses for a
              living, in New Zealand and Australia. He was happily married to a
              woman he loved, and they used to live together in Rotorua with a
              daughter and a son. He used to love horses –as he still does. He
              was kicked by a horse in a stable once, which led to him losing
              his sight permanently. He was bed-ridden for many weeks, and was
              in a coma (which thankfully ended shortly) as a result of being
              kicked by the above mentioned horse. Mike told me that his wife
              started seeing someone behind his back shortly after he went
              blind. She divorced him pretty quickly. Her boyfriend moved in
              with her and Mike moved to Hamilton to be close to some of his
              friends. The boyfriend went to jail soon after for embezzling
              money from his employers, thereby proving the adage &quot;once a
              thief, always a thief&quot;. But there was no going back to her
              for Mike. His wife meets him sometimes, but she went from
              relationship to relationship after her divorce with him. He has
              led a pretty lonely existence in all these years. His children
              have grown up now, and he gets satisfaction from seeing their
              progress in life. Verma is a relative of mine who went to America
              to try his fortune there. His sister, who was already there,
              helped to arrange his marriage with a local citizen. Shortly after
              the wedding, Verma discovered to his shock that his wife was
              involved with another man from before getting married to him, and
              was carrying on her affair with him. He lost his temper and
              shouted at her and slapped her once (once only). She called the
              police and got Verma locked up for a day. He was shut out of his
              own house and was forced to make weekly payments to her. He paid
              her what was a stiff amount for him, just to see the back of her.
              Later he moved back to India and he has made good progress in his
              personal life. My buddy Lim lives in Singapore. We used to work
              together in the Lion City. He was seeing a local lady those days
              who he had met while at varsity in Tasmania. He later on got
              married to her and she gave birth to his daughter. Her attitude
              changed after a few years for reasons which are still not clear.
              She started denying him sex. Poor Lim did not even protest, and
              suffered silently. After a couple of years of this treatment he
              filed for divorce. She fired back with every law at her disposal
              and he had to start paying her every month out of his paltry
              salary. Last I got an update, they had been locked in litigation
              for a few years over the question of child custody, maintenance,
              alimony, his wife&apos;s mental health status, and the divorce
              itself. &apos;Aliya&apos;, a friend in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan is an
              otorhinolaryngologist of more than twenty years experience. She
              got married to a politician&apos;s son soon after graduating from
              medical school and went on to have a daughter with him. He was
              evidently carrying on a clandestine liaison with another woman,
              and pretty soon left Aliya to be with her. Aliya filed for child
              support in court and was awarded a small regular payment till the
              daughter turned eighteen. The triple shock of the collapse of the
              Soviet Union with the consequent descent into poverty, the loss of
              her &apos;husband&apos;, and being pushed towards an uncertain
              future almost finished her off. The good doctor tried her luck at
              a number of relationships thereafter, but gave up after she got
              tired of being cheated or dumped.&apos;Nora&apos;, a neighbour in
              Auckland got separated from her husband after he left in search of
              better prospects in Australia, in the face of her protest. They
              carried on the charade of a long-distance marriage for a number of
              years, with Nora having a series of lovers –none of whom she was
              ready to commit to; and her husband out there doing most probably
              much the same. Eventually they got tired of the game and got
              divorced. &apos;Vasanta&apos; is a lady who I met while admitted
              at a hospital in Delhi earlier this year. I don&apos;t remember
              what her stated reason for getting admitted was, but it was clear
              that she was suffering due to a narcissistic husband. The man came
              to visit her for the first time on my third day there, and he was
              arguing with her and threatening her with ultimatums of leaving
              her whenever she tried to be slightly stern with him to get him to
              pay more attention to her. She was weeping and trying to reason
              with him at the same time. Her mother complained to the man that
              he did not get her admitted to the hospital, did not pay for her
              treatment, and did not visit her until that day. Clearly the
              husband was determined to get rid of Vasanta, and she was at risk
              of being forced to kill herself due to depression. Divorce plus
              high quality psychiatric treatment for the affected lady was the
              only solution here. I went up to her after her parents and
              &apos;husband&apos; had left the ward to continue their argument
              elsewhere, and suggested that she file a dowry harassment case
              against him. I told her that I myself was facing a concocted case,
              but I still felt that this was the correct remedy for a woman in
              her situation. She became fearful and asked me if I was a
              policeman. I sighed and gave up, but I told her to see a
              psychiatrist before getting a discharge. People like Vasanta,
              Michael, Lim, Aliya, Nora and Verma do not divorce because they
              love the idea of divorce, but because they have been kicked out of
              marriages by their narcissistic wife or husband. This phenomenon
              of extreme narcissism followed by divorce has assumed epidemic
              proportions in recent years all over the globe. This is,
              essentially, not a divorce epidemic. This is in fact a narcissism
              epidemic. What are the reasons for this? Well, first of all there
              is the global empowerment of women. Women have more rights than
              men in most countries. Men are the same as they used to be,
              according to feminists as well as laypersons. Whereas women have
              become more liberated than they used to be. They have a lot of
              options to choose from, and men are finding it hard to keep up
              with them. Successful and beautiful women have no shortage of
              admirers. There are many who can never be satisfied with any man.
              If they land a &apos;hunk&apos; they want a billionaire. If they
              hook a billionaire they want a hunk. There are also many women who
              are genuine sufferers. They are now able to get divorce, and get
              it on their own terms in many countries. But this option is
              available to other types of women too. Is it therefore a good
              thing or a bad thing that divorces due to termination of relations
              by women have skyrocketed? Gender biased laws have proliferated in
              the name of gender justice worldwide. Men are often left holding
              the bag, while women get easy divorce/ revenge/ perceived revenge/
              monetary gain in modern divorce laws and jurisprudence.
              Psychiatrists have reported that there is a discernible growth in
              narcissistic attitudes in the youth who attend educational
              institutions. There have been many studies in this area, with
              similar results. The average young person has become more
              narcissistic, and the whole population of the youth has seen an
              increase in the proportion of narcissists. This is a phenomenon
              which is not just limited to the young, as many people will
              testify anecdotally. Then there is the easy availability and
              constant presence of visual information about glamorous people and
              their lifestyles. Newspapers have been tabloidised. They now carry
              large daily supplements which showcase the lifestyles of social
              butterflies, fashion models and designers, billionaires, movie
              stars, rockstars, and people like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian,
              who are either famous for being famous, or serial divorcers, or
              both. There are also invariably photos of &apos;hot&apos; women
              and men in very little clothing to excite the sexual instincts of
              readers. Readers become used to this sort of stuff and it becomes
              aspirational for them. They then inflict these aspirations on
              their spouses and the result is there for all to see. Television
              channels have mushroomed. India for example has more than 700
              channels. Many of these channels show salacious material or
              material which does not reflect the lives of ordinary people, and
              they are a hit with young and old alike. People get influenced by
              such media content, and develop unrealistic fantasies about their
              desired partners. The effect on men and women, and its impact on
              the divorce rate is the same as that above (in the case of the
              tabloidised newspapers.) The internet is another source of
              garbage. Porn and glamour are available to all and sundry, and
              social networks enable communication at a moment&apos;s notice.
              With the increasing logged in time per person per day, the
              influence of people who wish him or her no good is increasing upon
              the individual. This argument is based upon the logic that the
              number of well-wishers that a person has is very small compared to
              mischievous elements. Such people misguide individuals and impair
              their judgment of good and bad. This has an impact on the personal
              relations of such people, including those relations which they
              have with their spouses. Mobile phone communications have
              increased the scope for communicating instantly. It is a great way
              for people to contact their friends and family if they wish to
              share something with them or know their whereabouts in times of
              worry. However these gadgets are also a great way for outsiders to
              interfere in the relationships of husband and wife. Outsiders may
              include malfeasants and employers. It is simply not good to be
              contactable by such persons all the time. Dating and matrimonial
              websites have proliferated, thus giving the illusion of great
              choice in romantic matters, and providing incentive to end
              relationships which may be improved with some effort. Millions of
              people are flirting with millions of other people online with no
              result except destruction of existing relationships, and creation
              of relationships which do not endure. Social networks and
              micro-blogging sites have the individual and all his activity as a
              central element. Women and successful men get a lot more attention
              on these websites than most normal or ordinary men. Many of them
              can get fifty or a hundred reactions on their comments / thoughts
              in the space of five minutes, from people with all sorts of
              motives. This gives a bloated sense of self-importance, and
              affects their ability to see the world as it really is. As if it
              was not enough that such people were getting a lot of attention in
              the real world, now their partners have to deal with their virtual
              popularity also. These are some reasons. Can you think of more?

              Is Quick Divorce Possible for Hindus?: Part 1

              A quick divorce is the holy grail of the Hindu matrimonial
              litigant. Like the real/fabled Holy Grail, it is a bit elusive. A
              Hindu marriage is not easy or quick to dissolve today. This is the
              accepted wisdom, and this is the widespread experience too. It is
              quite likely that the former is a result of the latter. This is a
              longish article, as an attempt is being made to examine the issue
              at hand in all its complexity. This writer recommends that you
              keep a large bag of chips handy when you start reading it. There
              are a number of aspects of law which need to be discussed when the
              question, &quot;(How) can I get a quick divorce if I am an Indian
              Hindu?&quot; is asked. You can see a list hereunder, which will
              hopefully grow as more articles on this topic are added. 1)
              Marriage law interpretation by the judiciary in terms of the
              sacredness of marriage 2) Use of criminal laws by women to render
              this interpretation meaningless 3) Refusal to repeal or defang an
              outdated law by the legal fraternity for reasons best known to
              itself Let us start with the first of these aspects. Hindu
              marriage law interpretation by the judiciary in terms of the
              sacredness of marriage. There have been innumerable court
              decisions in India wherein it has been held by the judge(s) that
              &quot;marriage is a sacrament for Hindus, and hence marriages
              cannot be dissolved easily&quot; (paraphrased). This gives rise to
              a number of questions which our lawyers for some reason do not
              appear to be asking (or as they love to say, &quot;for reasons
              best known to themselves(...)&quot;) Let me try to raise some of
              these doubts here. The first doubt is whether judges down the
              decades have examined the word &apos;sacrament&apos; in detail. A
              sacrament is more often used to describe a rite of passage or an
              obligatory ceremony than a sacred bond or a sacred promise. The
              Hindi equivalent for this particular meaning of this word is
              sanskaar or sanskara or sanskar or samskar or etc. As many readers
              know, this is the precise word which has been used to describe
              wedding ceremonies inter alia in sastric literature from the most
              ancient times down to Manu and subsequently Yajnavlakya or even
              commentators on Manu or Yajnavalkya&apos;s work. The paanigrahan
              sanskar is just one out of many sanskaars –sixteen to be exact,
              with seven still in prevalence– others being the mundan sanskar,
              daah sanskar, naamkaran sanskar, annaprasan sanskar, janma sanskar
              and, upanayan/yagyopaveet sanskar. Other, less common ones are
              garbhadhaan sanskar, punsavan, seemant/seemantnayan, nishkramana,
              karnavedh, vedarambh, samaavartana, sarva, and sanyaas sanskaars.
              And this is just the short list of sixteen. There are 48 in all if
              you want to be pedantic. In short, too many to list here.If 36
              fell into disuse over the times, and then nine more were reduced
              almost to nothingness, then isn&apos;t it logical that the
              remaining seven will also vanish one by one. How many families do
              you know who practice yagyopaveet sanskar? In fact this particular
              rite may well be rendered illegal by any random activist bench of
              judges one of these days due to its caste exclusivity. What about
              naamkaran? How many families have you known to have organised a
              religious ceremony just to give a child a name? Vivaah sanskar is
              also getting rough at the edges now as we all know. People are
              preferring to live together in cities without getting married. It
              is a recognisable trend in our country. The recent trend of
              accepting rape allegations at the end of relationships may put
              paid to this slightly older trend, but that is another story for
              another time. Bear in mind that the foregoing discussion is about
              weddings, and not about marriage. But when the very solemnisation
              of marriage is not de rigueur anymore then how can marriage remain
              solemn or sacred or bonds, say it how you will? This brings us to
              the next doubt, which arises from the freely interchangeable use
              of the words &apos;marriage&apos; and &apos;wedding&apos; in our
              country, and by extension in the legal arena. A ritual can be
              sacred without necessarily leading to a bond that is eternal. When
              a Prime Minister is sworn in, he is not sworn in for a guaranteed
              term of five years. It is the power of the people to elect their
              leader which is considered sacred here, and not the right of a
              constitutional authority to remain in power for a full term by
              virtue of being elected. Similarly, would it not make more sense
              if the happiness of the pair of individuals in a marriage is
              considered sacred instead of a bond which may outlive its utility
              due to circumstance or human created factors? Another question
              which is raised automatically is that how is it possible that
              something which is a sacred bond can be broken. Is it not
              paradoxical that you are talking about divorce in your Act and
              simultaneously claiming that marriage is a sacred bond? If
              something is made by God, then how can mere humans destroy it? The
              judges of our country are surely aware that what is sacred is
              eternal and inviolable by any earthly force? How then can they
              reconcile the fact that the Hindu Marriage Act permits divorce
              with their assertion that marriage is a sacrament in the sense of
              being eternal? And how is it that human beings can define
              conditions, the fulfilment of which is assumed to conclude that a
              heretofore sacred bond stands broken? Upon desertion, or an act of
              cruelty perpetrated by one partner on the other, or by one partner
              losing his mind, or by one partner contracting a venereal disease,
              or indeed due to any other reason? Has there been a voice from
              heaven, an akaashvaani, about this matter? And how is it that the
              periods in these conditions are what they are, and not anything
              else? Why do exactly two years of desertion lead to the breaking
              of the sacred bond, for instance, and why not five years or eight
              months or a century of years? The concept of Hindu marriage being
              a sacred sacrament comes in part from the rather sparse literature
              related to the legal aspects of marriage between Hindus. This
              includes commentaries. Most writers do not seem to bother to delve
              deep into the subject matter, and most judges are happy to
              regurgitate in court what they have been fed by these writers.
              Interestingly, these writers normally put this observation in
              sections of their books which come before their examination of the
              Hindu Marriage Act, whereas judges are prima facie ruling purely
              according to the letter of the Act. and not with reference to any
              commentary by anyone. Is it possible that the preliminary
              observations contained in the initial sections of these books are
              seen as an integral part of the respective writers&apos; reviews
              of the Act by the readers of these writers? Many of the aforesaid
              set of writers are devout Hindus in addition to being scholars of
              various shades –usually legal scholars. It is often observed in
              our country that devout Hindus and Muslims take each other&apos;s
              religions as a reference point (to the exclusion of all other
              religions) which must be opposed. Hindu (bigoted?) experts are
              heard to say on such occasions that the only agenda of Muslims is
              to do the opposite of what Hindus do, and that the Hindu way is
              more scientific or humane. Muslim (bigoted?) experts are heard to
              say that the Islamic way of doing things has corrected all the
              foolishnesses of the Hindu faith. It is not for this writer to
              judge the merits and demerits of these arguments at this place,
              but might it be wondered that the Hindu scholars&apos; description
              of Hindu marriage as a sacred sacrament is inspired by their view
              of Muslim marriage as a social contract? This assertion about the
              Muslim view is fairly common in the literature, and equally common
              is the mention of the former assertion in the same place as the
              latter. Might this be concluded to be proof that the foregoing
              question has an affirmative answer? To digress a little bit, the
              funny thing here is that Muslims call their wives their
              shareek-e-hayaats, or their partners on the pathway to heaven /
              enlightenment, but have no compunctions in letting them go when
              they get tired of them or when it becomes impossible to continue
              to live with them (depending upon who you are talking to). So is
              it not correct to say that Islam sees a conjugal partnership as
              something which is not limited by our earthly lives but which can
              be dissolved on Earth? This would appear to be a very practical
              view if it were not for the difficulty faced by Muslim women when
              they wish to dissolve a marriage. But this is not the place to
              open that can of worms. Use of criminal laws by women to render
              the interpretation referred to in the section above meaningless.
              Only men have been left to bear the burden of the sacredness of
              marriage ever since dowry related laws like the Dowry Prohibition
              Act and Section 498a of the IPC have been enacted. If a woman sees
              that her husband is not willing to grant her the divorce which she
              seeks, all she has to do is file a criminal complaint under any of
              these sections against him and sundry members of his family. When
              the poor husband has to run around lawyers&apos; offices, courts,
              and mahila thanas just to maintain his family&apos;s freedom, he
              very quickly surrenders and grants his consent for divorce. This
              means that women do not have to bear any portion of the weight of
              the judicial notion of sacredness of marriage amongst Hindus.
              (Dowry laws work in a similar fashion for Muslim women too, and
              thereby give them an option which their personal law does not
              provide.) These criminal laws operate (in combination with the
              various compulsory waiting periods) in another related way also,
              which is as an enabler of extortion. If a man files a divorce case
              against his wife shortly after she abandons him, she normally
              visits a lawyer. Lawyers are often unscrupulous and they advise
              such wives to file criminal complaints in their local CAW cells.
              Bear in mind that the CAW cell procedure does not usually take
              anything more than six months. This fact combined with the
              compulsory waiting period of a minimum of one year&apos;s
              separation before filing a petition for divorce by mutual consent
              means that the wife is quite likely to be able to carry out a
              successful legal shakedown before the earliest possible time for
              an MCD petition arrives. So the wife does not risk wasting any
              extra time than the minimum amount of time which is required in
              any event by her act of setting the wheels of the law enforcement
              authorities into motion. Do not forget however, that this is only
              one of the reasons for the vindictive actions of wives in marital
              litigation in the 21st Century; and also remember the fact that
              wives often file CAW cell complaints for extortion purposes
              without waiting for their husbands to file for divorce. Usually
              when a person sees his or her marriage falling apart, he or she
              starts worrying about how to find the next person for marriage. It
              is human instinct to start searching for an alternative option as
              soon as the previously thought to be reliable choice becomes
              unreliable or unpredictable. If there was a small waiting period
              before filing for divorce, or none at all, then women would not
              think such idle thoughts as how to extort some money during the
              compulsory wait.

              A small cross-section of legal experts have been known to hold
              that laws need to be made only for those problems which plague
              large portions of society, and not for problems which are faced by
              a small or arguably microscopic number of individuals every year
              in this great land of ours. Feminist lawyers are at the forefront
              of this tribe of experts when it comes to laws concerning any
              aspect of gender relations. Many such lawyers have become VIPs in
              recent years. A related theory is that laws which do more harm
              than good should be removed from the books. (Conversely, it can be
              said that laws which benefit only a small portion of litigants
              need to be repealed or refashioned to benefit large sections of
              litigants.) This latter appears to be a rational formulation, as
              opposed to its arbitrary cousin. Just to take one example of the
              feminist / feminazi lawyers referred to above, there is one woman
              who appears to live in a universe where a rather high percentage
              of the male population are potential criminals. She is expectedly
              shrill in her demands –invariably refusing to meet her opponents
              halfway. She has reached a good position in the government
              hierarchy over the course of a longish career, and this has
              provided her with a ready audience every time she speaks up. One
              of her clients (herself a lawyer who has formerly worked as an
              intern) referred to her as Additional Solicitor General of India
              in a recent communiqué. The funny thing here is that an additional
              solicitor general is a designation for government officers, and is
              not a constitutional post. You do not often hear people calling
              somebody Section Officer of India or Undersecretary of India, do
              you? Could this be an example of self-aggrandisement by proxy?
              Perhaps not. Lawyers are known to be canny, and this woman would
              not have wanted her client to embarrass her in print at a time
              when she herself was trying to humiliate a retired senior legal
              officer with sarcastic overuse of the word &apos;lordship&apos; in
              a case triggered by purported disclosures made by the aforesaid
              lawyer-client. All the same, it was fun to see the ironical
              situation of this particular Grand Poobah, and to see her being
              embarrassed by her own client. A not entirely unrelated thought
              here would be to note that an internship undergone by a member of
              one gender may pave the way for internment of her advisor/senior
              –if that person were to happen to be a member of the opposite
              gender– under the evolving legal dispensation in our country(!)
              Let us shift the focus back to the point about laws concerning
              those atrocities which affect a very small number of people each
              year. When it was demanded that the proposed law against acid
              attacks be made gender neutral, many prominent feminist lawyers
              said that acid attacks are made only against women, and that men
              do not deserve this legal protection. Luckily better sense
              prevailed and the new law was made equal for both men and women.
              It appears that there exist people in authority who share this
              writer&apos;s view that gender law is too important to be left to
              the mercy of feminist lawyers. The law is in any case too
              important to be run by lawyers to the exclusion of all others,
              just as the economy is too important to be left to the whims of
              economists. As has been mentioned elsewhere in this website,
              lawyers wield incredible influence in all branches of the polity
              in our republic, and India has been reduced today to a republic of
              the lawyers by the lawyers for the lawyers. Lawyers across the
              nation benefit tremendously from protracted litigation triggered
              or sustained by unfair laws. The strident and legally authorised
              interference of lawyers in the creation of laws and their total
              supremacy in the administration of justice needs to be curbed,
              this is my humble opinion. Similarly (at the risk of sounding
              repetitive) it must be said that feminists cannot be presumed by
              any stretch of the imagination to represent the female gender in
              all its vastness and variety.Look at the divorce related
              litigation which takes place every year in family courts across
              the country –and not just under the Hindu Marriage Act. It can be
              clearly observed that the overwhelming majority of litigants try
              to get out of their marriages in as short a time as legally
              possible. A small percentage of brainwashed or self-defeating
              (usually both) litigants go on fighting cases year after year.
              People who try to end their litigation as soon as possible belong
              to the category of litigants who have realised that the Hindu
              Marriage Act is not conducive to a resolution of disputes within a
              reasonable time frame. Endemic judicial delay in India combines
              with this law to worsen the suffering. Smart people realise that
              they should get out while they are still sane. Absurd or romantic
              notions of a long fight for justice inspire the ones who go on
              plodding through our family courts and subsequent levels of our
              judiciary. In the end, this class of people gets ripped off to put
              it plainly. The people who give them the aforesaid notions of
              justice are precisely the people who cheat them. It must be
              admitted that there are a few persons in the second category of
              litigants who are happy with the Act and love to see their paper
              marriages endure years of enjoyable rounds of courts. It is a side
              benefit that their paper spouses suffer all this while. So the
              Hindu Marriage Act is causing pain to most litigants, while only a
              small percentage get benefitted by its obdurate provisions. Even
              this benefit is in the form of masochistic satisfaction and
              nothing more. At this point let us look back at the hypothesis in
              the first paragraph of this article (the one within brackets).
              Does it ring a few bells, litigant? A number of old statutes have
              been removed from the books because they were causing misery in
              society, and were causing harm to the interests of citizens. Is it
              not time to do the same to the oppressive portions of the Hindu
              Marriage Act? There will be lot of resistance from lawyers if an
              attempt is made to bring about such change. Every extra month
              spent in litigation makes the litigant more desperate, and lawyers
              are keenly aware that desperate people are ready to shell out more
              money than people who are in a normal frame of mind. This brings
              us to a related topic –that of long waiting periods in the Act.

              If your wife has left you for unexplained reasons, you might wish
              to consider making a pre-emptive complaint against her at your
              local police station. Such a complaint comes in handy at the time
              when she decides to file any sort of charges against you in court
              or at the CAW Cell. This is also called a non-cognisable complaint
              or an NCC because it is usually not actionable at the police
              station level, and needs to be followed up with a court order to
              start any kind of proceedings. To Station House Officerxxth Month
              20zz xyz Colony Police Station New Delhi Madam / Sir, This is to
              inform you that my son 498a victim got married to Mrs. 498a,
              daughter of abc xyz, resident of xyz colony/village on xxth Month
              20zz at Venue, xyz road, abc colony, New Delhi. Following the
              marriage, Mrs. 498a moved to our house at house no yy/yy, xyz
              colony. She continued to make frequent visits to her parents’
              home. Marriage was normal, with cordial relations and without any
              rancour from either side (this is optional(actually everything is
              optional)). Our son tried his best to make her feel at home and
              participated in her hobby of going to a particular temple in xyz
              area every (day of week), where she is a long-standing devotee. He
              also went with her regularly to the local gym, and a few times to
              malls, restaurants, and movies. From xxth Month 20zz, without any
              provocation, fight, argument, overt disagreement, or even any
              heated discussion, Mrs. 498a, without declaring her decision,
              stopped having conjugal relations with 498a victim, and even
              stopped any display of physical affection.. About a fortnight
              later, when 498a victim requested her to resume normal married
              relations, she said that there was no “connection” between her and
              498a victim, and she would not resume normal relations. She stayed
              in our house as a member of the family till xxth Month 20zz. In
              between she took her jewellery (on xxth Month, 20zz), some clothes
              (also on xxth Month, 20zz), and the marriage album (on xxth Month,
              20zz) to her parents’ place and left them there. On xxth Month she
              took a few bags of clothes, and saying that she will be back on
              the next Tuesday, she left our house, and till date has not
              returned to stay. She still keeps the keys to her almirah, as was
              her practice even while she was living with us, while she was in
              the house or outside. (Details about taking away jewellery etc.
              may be withheld at this stage. Talk to your lawyer.) On xxth Month
              2012 afternoon, when I was alone in the house, she came with her
              mother, opened her almirah, and took almost all her clothes. She
              came again on the xxth of Month, this time alone, and shouted at
              and abused me and my wife and left after half an hour. Again she
              came on Saturday, xxth Month, 20zz, took some more clothes from
              her almirah and left after one hour without saying even a word. On
              xxth Month, 2012, her mother abc xyz called my wife on the
              telephone, and abused and threatened her. Sir, we are senior
              citizens and we are alone in our home during daytime. We are
              afraid that Mrs. 498a or her family may attempt to harm us or to
              foist some false charges on us. Thanking you Faithfully yours name
              of father house no. yy/yy, xyz colony New Delhi-1100xx{" "}

              This list is tricky in this writer&apos;s opinion because it uses
              unclear language and mixes gifts given by parents and in-laws into
              one heading. The language used is accusatory, and every putative
              thing that has been gifted has been labelled as dowry. Preparing
              an admit list for such a stridhan list is slightly more difficult
              than preparing a reply to a typical stridhan list. You might think
              that this list is less dangerous than a typical list because the
              number of items is lesser here. This is incorrect for the reasons
              mentioned, plus the fact that the amounts in this list are (I have
              to say possibly) inflated and add up to a tidy sum. This list in
              its present avatar is a typical scare tactic because it has the
              effect of mentally disturbing the husband&apos;s family due to the
              combination of high figures, pressure to compromise, and
              unquestioning acceptance of the wife&apos;s version by the CAW
              Cell. Get used to taking scare tactics in your stride in this
              battle. Text of the list follows: List of expenditure, and gifts

              Full form of F.I.R. Top of Page The abbreviation F.I.R. means
              First Information Report. This is the term used to describe a
              police report in our country. The abbreviation has acquired a life
              of its own and has become a word of daily use now. Eff Ai Aar.
              FIR. This (daily use of this word) is especially true in the
              circles in which you are moving these days, which is to say
              amongst lawyers, police, and judges. The word &quot;report&quot;
              is commonly used as short for &quot;F.I.R.&quot; The FIR in 498a
              cases is not registered by the police immediately upon receipt of
              complaint. The opposite is true in 304b cases. Procedure for
              registration of an F.I.R. Top of Page The procedure for
              registration of an FIR is simple in the simplest case. A
              complainant, who is usually the victim (or one of the victims) of
              a crime approaches the police with news of occurrence of a crime
              either within the area of jurisdiction of the said police station
              or outside its area of jurisdiction. The police is required by law
              to either take a complaint from him / her in writing OR to note
              down his verbal description of the crime which has taken place. If
              the offence which is described by the complainant (regardless of
              whether it is true or false) constitutes one or more than one
              cognizable crimes then the police is required to register an FIR.
              This is usually done after taking approval of the same from the
              SHO / police post incharge. At other times the procedure is longer
              but here we are talking about the simplest case. Cognizable crimes
              are that category of crimes upon whose news the police is
              authorised to initiate criminal proceedings without the permission
              of a court of law AND duty-bound to initiate such proceedings
              without waiting for an order from a court of law. These crimes
              include most crimes which are punishable with 3 or more years
              imprisonment under the Indian Penal Code or any other law. CrPC
              Section 154 [1] [2] is the legal basis for compulsory registration
              of FIR upon receipt of complaint. It is reproduced hereunder— S.
              154 – Information in cognizable cases (source: devgan.in) 1) Every
              information relating to the commission of a cognizable offence, if
              given orally to an officer in charge of a police station, shall be
              reduced to writing by him or under his direction, and be read over
              to the informant; and every such information, whether given in
              writing or reduced to writing as aforesaid, shall be signed by the
              person giving it, and the substance thereof shall be entered in a
              book to be kept by such officer in such form as the State
              Government may prescribe in this behalf. Provided that if the
              information is given by the woman against whom an offence under
              section 326A, section 326B, section 354, section 354A, section
              354B, section 354C, section 354D, section 376, [1]section 376A,

              Penal Code is alleged to have been committed or attempted, then
              such information shall be recorded, by a woman police officer or
              any woman officer; Provided further that— a) In the event that the
              person against whom an offence under section 354, section 354A,

              section 376DA, section 376DB, section 376E or section 509 of the
              Indian Penal Code is alleged to have been committed or attempted,
              is temporarily or permanently mentally or physically disabled,
              then such information shall be recorded by a police officer, at
              the residence of the person seeking to report such offence or at a
              convenient place of such person’s choice, in the presence of an
              interpreter or a special educator, as the case may be; b) The
              recording of such information shall be video graphed; c) The
              police officer shall get the statement of the person recorded by a
              Judicial Magistrate under clause (a) of sub-section (5A) of
              section 164 as soon as possible. 2) A copy of the information as
              recorded under Sub-Section (1) shall be given forthwith, free of
              cost, to the informant. 3)Any person, aggrieved by a refusal on
              the part of an officer in charge of a police station to record the
              information referred to in Sub-Section (1) may send the substance
              of such information, in writing and by post, to the Superintendent
              of Police concerned who, if satisfied that such information
              discloses the commission of a cognizable offence, shall either
              investigate the case himself or direct an investigation to be made
              by any police officer subordinate to him, in the manner provided
              by this Code, and such officer shall have all the powers of an
              officer in charge of the police station in relation to that
              offence. Footnotes to CrPC Section 154 (source: Ministry of Home
              Affairs, Government of India) 1) Certain words substituted by
              Section 11(i) of Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018 (Act no. 22 of
              2018) w.e.f. 11th August 2018 2) Certain words substituted by
              Section 11(ii) of Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018 (Act no. 22
              of 2018) w.e.f. 11th August 2018 The requirement to register an
              FIR immediately upon receive of any complaint which discloses the
              commission of a cognizable offence has also been explained –in
              detail‐ in a Constitution Bench judgment in what is known as the
              Lalita Kumari case [3]. Receipt of every complaint is recorded in
              2 registers which are kept in every police station. One is the
              daily diary and the other is the register of complaints. There is
              also a third register called the register of FIRs. If an FIR is
              registered upon a complaint then this fact is recorded in 3
              registers, being the daily diary, the register of complaints, and
              the register of FIRs. The concerned police station is required by
              law to provide a copy of the FIR to the complainant (ref. CrPC
              Section154(1) above). Does an F.I.R. always contain First
              Information? Top of Page An FIR –going by its name– should be
              based upon the first information (about the commission of a crime)
              received by the police. This does not always happen. When FIR does
              not contain first information due to preliminary enquiry Top of
              Page Sometimes the police does not immediately register an FIR
              because it wants to make preliminary enquiries based upon the
              information received by it (not being a written complaint) from
              various sources. It then first carries out such preliminary
              enquiry and later writes a &quot;first information&quot; report in
              its own language. At some other times the police is required
              either by law or by procedure laid down by law to carry out such a
              preliminary enquiry before registering an FIR. The version which
              is put down in writing after preliminary enquiry is thus a second
              or latter, and modified version of the information originally
              received by the police. Crime against women cells have been
              established in every state to handle dowry cases and the job of
              these CAW cells is inter alia to carry out a preliminary enquiry
              upon receipt of dowry complaints. When FIR does not contain first
              information due to inadvertent inaccuracies Top of Page Sometimes
              the complainant is illiterate or not sufficiently literate, and is
              not able to write down the details of the alleged crime. As a
              result, any first information which is received is in verbal form,
              and small differences occur between what the complainant says and
              what the police writes down. Less serious (than first information)
              FIR due to corruption / political pressure Top of Page At other
              times the information (not being a written complaint) is modified
              while putting it down in black and white. An incorrect and watered
              down version of the complaint is recorded. This usually happens
              due to bribery / corruption, or due to misuse of influence by
              various centres of power, or because of political pressure. KPS
              Gill managed to convince the Punjab and Haryana High Court in a
              quashing petition u/s 482 CrPC that no offence was made out in the
              clear as day molestation complaint filed against him by Rupan Deol
              Bajaj. The problem for Gill was that the whole world held an
              opinion contrary to the Punjab and Haryana HC, and that the
              Supreme Court –where Mrs. Bajaj and her husband filed two separate
              SLPs [4] against the high court judgment– agreed with the whole
              world instead of agreeing with the Punjab and Haryana High Court.
              More serious (than facts / first information) FIR due to media
              pressure / corruption / political pressure Top of Page Corruption
              in various forms and political pressure often lead to the opposite
              also,i.e. F.I.Rs in which details are modified to make them more
              severe than what actually happened. In such cases also the F.I.R.
              is incorrect, but modification of the original complaint is NOT
              the reason for its being incorrect. Rather, the original written
              complaint itself is either incorrect or legally unsustainable. The
              Nisha Sharma / Munish Dalal dowry case is a prime example of
              exaggeration due to media pressure, wherein an FIR u/s 498A of IPC
              was registered even though the complainant never completed
              solemnisation of the proposed wedding, and hence was not the wife
              of the accused. Note that only the wife or a family member of the
              wife of any man is permitted to raise a complaint u/s 498A. Other
              / miscellaneous causes of non-inclusion of first information Top
              of Page It might also happen that the victim of a crime is put out
              of action, or there is no complainant due to the death of all the
              victims of a particular crime. In such cases the first information
              received by the police is invariably from other sources, and often
              such sources are unwilling to put down their complaint in writing.
              The police is duty bound to register an FIR in a number of types
              of crime, and they are forced in such situations to write the
              report themselves. It may even happen that the person who reports
              a crime has no locus standi which may render him eligible to be
              the complainant. In such cases a situation may arise due to
              various factors which may force the police to record the crime in
              their own language. Delays in FIRs and delays because of delayed
              FIRs Top of Page The subject of delays in criminal proceedings is
              interesting not only for litigants and lawyers but for the whole
              country. Here some aspects of such delays are explained in brief.
              Is it possible that an FIR is delayed in spite of timely
              complaint? Top of Page There is a common saying that anything is
              possible in the great country of India. Delay of FIR in spite of
              timely complaint is a very small thing, and history has witnessed
              that such small things are very common in here. There can be no
              greater example of this sorry fact than the late registration of
              FIRs after the mass murder of Sikhs in Delhi and a few other
              cities in the days after Indira Gandhi&apos;s assassination. The
              globally known and published offences took place in October and
              November 1984 during Rajiv Gandhi&apos;s first few days as PM, but
              FIRs were registered in dozens of cases even as late as 1990,
              1991, 1992, and 1993, [5] after he had passed away in similarly
              tragic circumstances. If this was not bad enough, all the FIRs
              related to murders of Sikhs in Kanpur the days after and including
              31st October 1984 were destroyed by Uttar Pradesh Police [6] staff
              &apos;working&apos; in Kanpur. Is police legally bound to accept
              late complaints? (Statute of Limitations (criminal law)) Top of
              Page The statute of limitations is that law in any country which
              declares the number of years which may be allowed to expire before
              admitting an FIR is rendered legally impossible. In India, section
              468 of CrPC is the law in this regard, insofar as criminal law is
              concerned [7] [8]. According to this section, the limitation
              period for any offence which is punishable by a fine only is six
              months, that for any offence which is punishable by a prison term
              up to one year is one year, and that for any offence which is
              punishable by a prison term from one to three years is three
              years. Section 468 – Bar to taking cognizance after lapse of the
              period of limitation (source: devgan.in) (1) Except as otherwise
              provided elsewhere in this Code, no Court, shall take cognizance
              of an offence of the category specified in Sub-Section (2), after
              the expiry of the period of limitation. (2) The period of
              limitation shall be– (a) Six months, if the offence is punishable
              with fine only; (b) One year, if the offence is punishable with
              imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year; (c) Three years,
              if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term
              exceeding one year but not exceeding three years. (3) [1]For the
              purposes of this section, the period of limitation, in relation to
              offences which may be tried together, shall be determined with
              reference to the offence which is punishable with the more severe
              punishment or, as the case may be, the most severe punishment.
              Footnote to CrPC Section 468 (source: Indiankanoon.org) 1) 1.
              Provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to certain economic
              offences, see the Economic Offences (Inapplicability of
              Limitation) Act, 1974 (12 of 1974 ), s. 2 end Sch. Since section
              498a is punishable by a maximum of 3 years, any complaint relating
              to dowry harassment or dowry cruelty must be reported within three
              years of the last claimed incident. The same is true of section
              406, which relates to criminal breach of trust. Section 34 is
              punishable by one year in prison in the worst case, so if any
              complaint under sections 498a/406/34 is made more than one year
              after the reported offence, then section 34 must be not included
              in the FIR, lest it be quashed partly or in toto. Are delayed
              F.I.Rs taken seriously by courts? (Warrant cases, Serious crimes,
              Heinous crimes) Top of Page In many crimes a delayed FIR is not
              taken seriously by the courts. In many other crimes an FIR is
              accepted as a weighty document regardless of any delay. In serious
              crimes (crimes which may be punished by 7 years in prison) delays
              are condoned more easily than in warrant cases (cases relating to
              crimes which may be punished by 2 or more years in prison). In
              heinous crimes (crimes which may be punished by life in prison or
              death) any delay in registering an FIR is immaterial. Insofar as
              dowry cases are concerned, courts tend to take delayed complaints
              under IPC section 498a, IPC section 406, and IPC section 34 with a
              pinch of salt. An FIR is compulsory upon complaint –with a small
              caveat in the case of 498a– since all these sections pertain to
              cognisable crimes. In cases involving Section 498a of the CrPC the
              caveat established by law is that there is a CAW cell procedure
              which the complainant and the prime accused have to undergo before
              a decision is taken about forwarding the complaint to the relevant
              police station. ► Use the comments section at the bottom of the

              ingredients of an FIR Top of Page Madabhushi Sridhar has done a
              fairly comprehensive analysis of FIRs in his work FIR, Arrest and
              Bail (Sridhar, M.; FIR, Arrest and Bail; Asia Book House;
              Hyderabad; 2010) [9]. He quotes earlier experts as having declared
              that an FIR needs to have eleven essential Ws in it. It is to be
              noted however that any such list of ingredients is as a matter of
              fact only a desirable list of ingredients This is because no FIR
              is legally inadmissible, regardless of whether or not it contains
              any or all so-claimed essentials. The &quot;essential Ws&quot; are
              listed in Sridhar&apos;s book as paraphrased below— 1) What
              information has been conveyed by the complainant / informant? 2)
              In What capacity has this information been conveyed? 3) Who
              committed the crime? 4) Against Whom was the crime committed? 5)
              When was the crime committed? 6) Where was the crime committed? 7)
              Why was the crime committed? That is to ask, What was the motive?
              8) In Which way was the crime carried out / What was the modus
              operandi? 9) Are there any Witnesses? Who are they? 10) What was
              taken away by the accused? Or What was the damage done by the
              accused? 11) What traces were left by the accused? It is
              compulsory for the complainant to sign the FIR Top of Page
              According to the CrPC, any person who provides information to the
              police about a crime is obliged to sign the FIR (ref. CrPC
              Section154(1) above). He or she is liable to be imprisoned for up
              to 3 months in case of a refusal to do so. This provision is
              almost never enforced. At least this writer has never heard about
              such a thing happening. Another interesting thing is that the CrPC
              does not define what an FIR is anywhere through its length. Even
              the phrase &quot;first information report&quot; does not occur
              anywhere in the code (i.e. in the CrPC). Hearsay as a basis for an
              FIR Top of Page Different writers have different views about
              hearsay becoming a basis for an FIR. Most writers say that if
              somebody provides vague or unreliable information, it cannot be
              considered to be an FIR even if it is in written form. Janak Raj
              Jai however, holds that hearsay is a perfect valid basis for an
              FIR. (Jai, J.R., Bail Law and Procedures, Universal Law Publishing
              Company, Delhi, 2012) [10] Medico Legal Certificate Top of Page If
              somebody provides information about an injury to a person, then
              the SHO is duty bound to record the same in the daily diary and to
              reach the hospital urgently to verify the truth of the claim made
              by the informant. Another essential purpose of the hospital visit
              is to ensure timely carrying out of medico-legal formalities. The
              MLC or the medico-legal certificate is an important piece of proof
              in any FIR. A wife&apos;s case becomes much stronger in dowry
              cases if she has such a document in her possession. However, there
              are a number of cases every week in which deception by the
              complainant is exposed by criminal defence lawyers in spite of the
              existence of MLCs. This sometimes leads to filing of charges
              against the lying complainant. Can an FIR be used as evidence? Top
              of Page Another interesting theme explored by Madabhushi Sridhar
              in his book (see above) is whether an FIR can be used as evidence.
              He says that an FIR cannot be considered to be evidence. It is
              just a piece of information which sets the legal wheels in motion
              and forms the basis for the investigation which is to be carried
              out by the police. The statements given by witnesses, the
              arguments given by counsel, the evidence laid on the table in
              court, these are all superior to the FIR in terms of deciding the
              case at hand. If these items corroborate the FIR, then the chances
              of conviction increase multifold. If however, they contradict the
              FIR, then the case becomes weak, because the FIR cannot be used to
              overrule these items. The truth emerges in court, or at the very
              least it is deemed to emerge in court, and the FIR is not the
              deciding factor in such proceedings. The foregoing should give
              great courage and hope to 498a accused men and their parents,
              because this is clear (paraphrased) indication by a senior teacher
              of law that a good criminal lawyer can destroy the entire edifice
              of lies generated by your 498a wife, her family, and her sponsors.
              Supreme Court decisions which negate use of FIR as evidence Top of
              Page There are a number of Supreme Court judgments wherein use of
              FIR as a piece of substantive evidence has been forbidden by the
              court. Three full-bench judgments [11] [12] [13] are extracted
              here– The State of Bombay vs Rusy Mistry And Another Top of Page

              of India Das, S. (J) Gajendragdkar, P. (J) Subba Rao, K. (J) Held
              (in the 7th paragraph of the judgment): &quot;...The first
              information report is the information recorded under Section 154
              of the Cr. P. C. It is an information given to a police officer
              relating to the commission of an offence. It is also an
              information given by an informant on which the investigation is
              commenced. It must be distinguished from information received
              after the commencement of the investigation which is covered by
              Sections 161 and 162 of the Cr. P. C. It is well-settled that the
              first information report is not substantive evidence, but can only
              be used to corroborate or contradict the evidence of the informant
              given in court or to impeach his credit. It follows that a Judge
              cannot place such a report before the jury as substantive
              evidence, but can only refer to that portion of it which had been
              used for one or other of the aforesaid purposes.&quot; (emphasis

              Procedure provides for the recording of the first information. The
              information report as such is not substantive evidence. It may be
              used to corroborate the informant under s. 157 of the Evidence Act
              or to contradict him under s. 145 of the Act, if the informant is

              Khanna, H.R. (J) Held (in the 10th paragraph of the judgment):
              &quot;Now first information report is a report relating to the
              commission. of an offence given to the police and recorded by it
              under s. 154, Cr. P.C. As observed by the Privy Council in H.E. v.
              Khwaja(1) the receipt and recording of information report by the
              police is not a condition precedent to the setting in motion of a
              criminal investigation. Nor does the statute provide that such
              information report can only be made by an eye witness. First
              information report under s. 154 is not even considered a
              substantive piece of evidence. It can only be used to corroborate
              or contradict the informant&apos;s evidence in court. But this
              information when recorded is the basis of the case set up by the
              informant. It is very useful if recorded before there is time and
              opportunity to embellish or before the informant&apos;s memory
              fades.&quot; (emphasis supplied) Circumstances under which (some
              portion of) an FIR becomes substantive evidence Top of Page An FIR
              (or part of it) becomes substantive evidence if it is admitted as
              substantive evidence by the concerned court. This happens in 3
              common circumstances and in a few additional circumstances, all of
              which can be seen in Section 32 of the Indian Evidence Act. As far
              as the 3 common circumstances are concerned, you can see the 1st
              circumstance here, the 2nd circumstance here, and the 3rd
              circumstance here). These 3 common circumstances are all
              contemplated in Section 32(1) of the Indian Evidence Act, and all
              of them relate to death. Note that certain statements made by dead
              persons can be admitted under Section 8 and / or Section 6 of the
              Indian Evidence Act also (apart from under Section 32(1) of the
              Indian Evidence Act) as can be seen in Damodarprasad
              Chandrikaprasad for Section 8 (see below) and Rattan Singh for
              Section 6 (see below). Coming to the rest of Section 32 of the
              Evidence Act, note that a full bench of the Supreme Court has
              declared in Kans Raj (see below) that any statement admitted under
              any sub-section of Section 32 (and not just under Section 32(1))
              of the Indian Evidence Act constitutes substantive evidence, after
              it is proved by the person or the agency relying upon such
              statement that such statement was in fact made by the concerned
              person. If this position is accepted as a clear and unambiguous
              statement then it becomes necessary to say that if certain types
              of statements of not only dead persons but of those persons who
              cannot be found and of those persons whose attendance is
              unreasonably difficult to procure are contained in an FIR, then
              the said FIR becomes substantive evidence. The bare text of
              Section 32(1) [20] of the Evidence Act is as follows– Indian
              Evidence Act Section 32(1) – (source: devgan.in) Statements,
              written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is dead,
              or who cannot be found, or who has become incapable of giving
              evidence, or whose attendance cannot be procured, without an
              amount of delay or expense which under the circumstances of the
              case appears to the Court unreasonable, are themselves relevant
              facts in the following cases– (1) When it relates to cause of
              death: When the statement is made by a person as to the cause of
              his death, or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction
              which resulted in his death, in cases in which the cause of that
              person’s death comes into question. Such statements are relevant
              whether the person who made them was or was not, at the time when
              they were made, under expectation of death, and whatever may be
              the nature of the proceeding in which the cause of his death comes
              into question. Detailed explanation of the above indicated 3
              commonly seen circumstances is given hereunder— When an F.I.R.
              contains a dying declaration Top of Page If a dying declaration is
              a part of an FIR then the FIR becomes substantive evidence. (It is
              more reasonable to say that that part of the FIR becomes
              substantive evidence which consists of the said dying declaration,
              as also that part which is directly derived from the said dying
              declaration. It may further be conjectured here that the whole of
              the FIR in such cases is also eligible to be treated as
              substantive evidence if the judge decides to do so keeping in view
              the given matrix of facts, but conjectures are conjectures.) It is
              to be noted that every dying declaration is admissible as evidence
              under section 32(1) of the Indian Evidence Act, but only after it
              is established that such declaration had actually been made by the
              person who died. Further note that a dying declaration is
              admissible only in cases where the cause of death of the concerned
              person comes into question, albeit the nature of proceedings where
              it comes into question is immaterial. Another way of stating this
              is that dying declarations are admissible in all kinds of legal
              proceedings and not just in murder / suicide related proceedings,
              provided that the cause of the dead person&apos;s death comes into
              question within the said proceedings. When an FIR contains a
              declaration about probable cause of death of a dead person Top of
              Page If a person makes a statement about a probable cause of his
              death and later dies AND such statement becomes part of an FIR
              then that portion of the FIR which consists of such statement plus
              that part which is directly derived from such statement becomes
              substantive evidence. When an FIR contains a declaration about
              some circumstance related to death of a dead person Top of Page If
              a person makes a statement about some circumstance, and later it
              turns out that the circumstance was related to any transaction
              which led to his death then that portion of the FIR which consists
              of such statement plus that part which is directly derived from
              such statement becomes substantive evidence. The said circumstance
              may have occurred long before the death of the concerned person;
              this does not affect admissibility of the said statement. Supreme

              of house number such and such, so and so colony, New Delhi-1100xx
              Respected Sir, I, Mrs. 498a, got married to husband on xx/yy/20zz
              at New Delhi. This alliance was through an advertisement given in
              the newspaper by my mother-in-law. Our meeting was fixed up at
              such and such location, and on such and such date, our families
              met each other and I spoke to future husband for only half an
              hour. In that half hour I was the person who was speaking, my
              future husband spoke very little. My future husband gave an
              impression of being an introvert. Since it was a brief meeting and
              everything appeared to be fine, both the families agreed to the
              alliance. Also, since it was a second marriage for both me and my
              future husband, and our families were very keen that things work
              out. I was also willing to make adjustments, therefore, nothing
              much was looked into. I have not seen earlier divorce decree of
              husband and was never given any detail of his earlier marriage.
              His parents only disclosed that his divorce has recently been
              finalized. After this meeting I met my husband only on the day of
              marriage. Before marriage, my husband never called me on the phone
              also. I did not feel anything amiss and felt that it was due to
              his introverted nature. My mother-in-law was however, calling up
              my mother regularly to know what all purchases had been made and
              specifically asked my mother to give cash of Rs. 1,00,000/- and at
              the time of engagement in cash to my husband. She also asked my
              mother to give at least 2 gold sets in marriage. Finally we got
              married on xx/yy/20zz. The marriage function was preceded with an
              engagement ceremony at such and such venue in such and such
              location. On such and such date which was on the insistence of my
              mother-in-law. Since it was a second marriage, I as well as my
              parents wanted a low-key marriage, but my parents were forced to
              host this function also. In the engagement ceremony, apart from
              gold and diamond ring to my husband, the family members of my
              husband were given gifts and cash as per the demands of my
              mother-in-law.The marriage function was hosted by my parents for a
              baraat of about 200 people at such and such venue in such and such
              location, New Delhi. At the marriage ceremony also family members
              of my husband were given gifts and cash as per the demands of my
              mother-in-law. Once we reached the matrimonial home at about 11
              pm, all the family members including my husband and his parents
              quickly climbed the stair case and left me behind. I followed
              everyone and seeing a door ajar with all lights on, entered the
              house. As we reached home my mother-in-law asked me to hand over
              the jewellery to her since my parents had not given me an almirah
              in marriage. I found this a little strange but quietly took
              everything off except my engagement ring and two gold bangles and
              handed it over to my mother-in-law. I have not seen the rest of my
              jewellery since that day. When everyone had left, my mother-in-law
              told me that my parents should have at least given a Santro car if
              nothing more. She said that my husband could have gone to his
              office in a new car after his marriage. I told my mother-in-law
              that me and my husband can both earn and buy a car. My husband had
              no conversation with me that night except this that he was
              expecting that my parents would give a Santro car at which I kept
              quiet. He also said that we should have a baby. Even on the first
              night, before I was shown the bedroom which we had to share, my
              mother-in-law warned me that if I don&apos;t give them a kid then
              this marriage is finished. Throughout my stay in my marital home
              my mother-in-law used to abuse me and even slapped me. On the
              second day of marriage we again went to my parents&apos; house for
              a phera, when again my parents had to give gifts and cash to my
              husband and his family as per their demand. That day my
              mother-in-law asked my mother to hand over all the sagan cash
              received by me during the marriage and same was handed over to my
              mother-in-law. This incident left an unpleasant impression in my
              mind. On xx/yy/20zz in the morning my husband woke up at 6:30 am
              to get ready for work, while he abused me, called me names and was
              getting ready I asked him if he had planned for a honeymoon trip,
              he point blank said no as I do not like to go out. No one in my
              in-laws place cared for me even when I was suffering from fever.
              On xx/yy/20zz I woke up with fever and I told my husband that I
              have fever. He did not say anything to me or give any medicine to
              me. I told my mother-in-law that I have fever. She said that since
              I was the wife of xyz, his breakfast, lunch and dinner were my
              responsibility and under all circumstances, I have to cook for
              him. I started crying and cooked my husband&apos;s breakfast and
              lunch. After sometime I told my mother-in-law that I want to go
              home for a few days as I am not well. She did not allow me to go.
              Then I called my father and asked him to come and take me to a
              doctor. At around 7-7:30 in the evening my parents came and took
              me to the doctor. I had to visit a skin specialist on xx/yy/20zz.
              Since I had taken already appointment with the doctor, I asked my
              husband to take me to the doctor. He simply refused saying that
              you may go alone or ask your dad to take you. I again called up my
              father and requested him to take me to the doctor. After about 10
              days of marriage I wanted money since I had no money at all. I
              asked my husband to give me some money he refused saying that take
              money from my mother and not from me. Since I had no money at all
              with me and wanted to buy a few personal things, I asked my
              mother-in-law to give me Rs 1000/-. She asked me what all I needed
              and when I told her she said that Rs 500/- is sufficient and that
              I should not over spend. She also said that I do not do the
              household work properly. I was cooking breakfast for all of us.
              Cooking lunch for my husband and packing it up in the morning and
              since it was winter time making hot food for my mother-in-law and
              father-in-law. I was also washing clothes and was kept busy in the
              kitchen throughout the day by my mother-in-law and was abused
              whenever I failed to do anything as per her instruction. My
              husband has some strange habits. He would eat his breakfast no
              sooner he woke up in the morning without even brushing his teeth
              or washing his face. He did not take a bath for days together
              despite my insistence and was very unhygienic. He would eat his
              dinner the moment he entered the house after coming home from
              office around 6-6:15 pm. On xx/yy/20zz when he came home from his
              office he said that I need egg along with milk. I gave him 2 eggs
              along with milk after 5 minutes. When he finished eating he asked
              to give him bread along with milk saying that he did not have milk
              while he was eating egg. I was surprised to hear all this I told
              him that you just had milk along with eggs, he said is that so I
              don&apos;t remember. On xx/yy/20zz I saw a lot of medicines kept
              in my husband&apos;s almirah. I asked him about the medicines he
              said that these are my mother&apos;s medicines. I asked why are
              these medicines lying here. He had no answer for this. On the next
              week off again on Sunday this time in the morning I asked him that
              let&apos;s go out for a movie, since xyz cinema is just close by
              to abc colony. He refused again that I will not go. I asked him
              the reason of refusal. He said I will not go out in any public
              area, bomb must be planted outside it and I will die. He would
              come up with strange reasons to avoid going out which was
              troubling me since I was made to feel that I was there only to
              ensure the birth of a child. Thus, he avoided taking me out at all
              costs for reasons best known to him. I am a regular visitor to the
              temple in xyz area every Saturday about which I had told my
              husband on the very first day we had met. Even there he took me
              only two times (on xx/yy/20zz and xx/yy/20zz) and with great
              reluctance.

              I could not have any personal conversation with my husband since
              whatever we discussed he used to tell everything to his mother,
              even small things like abc is washing clothes, abc is ironing the
              clothes, abc had an apple etc. I tried discussing my
              husband&apos;s strange habits with my mother-in-law directly and
              as a friend. I spoke to her explaining everything and I told her
              that it Is not a short term relationship, and I have to stay with
              him and you. I explained everything about my husband that he does
              not have bath at all, he does not brush his teeth, he tends to
              forget things very fast, he does not want to go out with me. I
              even told her that I can&apos;t have any personal conversation
              with him as he tells her everything. I spoke to my mother-in-law
              as a friend thinking that I will get some positive resolution.
              Instead of helping me out she abused me saying that you are
              married to him now, you have to stay like this, and you don&apos;t
              have a choice. She threatened me that if you don&apos;t keep quiet
              you will have to face the consequences. On xx/yy/20zz my
              mother-law said that is your husband wife relationship normal? I
              said that it is normal that there is no problem. She said that
              remember that the purpose of marriage is to have children. You
              cannot have children if you do not want to try to have children. I
              was shocked to hear this. How can a mother-in-law talk to her
              daughter-in-law like this? My mother-in-law used to say those
              things to me which no one could say to her daughter-in-law. On
              xx/yy/20zz, my husband fought with me in filthy language without
              any reason or provocation and said that this marriage is finished
              since I am a useless cook and am not giving him enough to eat, and
              he slapped me 2-3 times in front of my mother-in-law. It was
              strange that my mother-in-law was standing and smiling when he was
              hitting me. After all this it became a trend for them to abuse me
              and torture me physically. Every morning my mother-in-law used to
              abuse me and my family. She used to slap me every now and then,
              and said that ask your parents to give us a car since my son has a
              car which is 5 years old and wants a new car. My husband used to
              hit me every night on one or the other pretext. Though it was a
              second marriage for me and I wanted this marriage to work out I
              did not retaliate to whatever was happening with me. On
              xx/yy/20zz, my parents invited my husband for my nephew&apos;s
              birthday. He refused (and said) that he will not come for the
              birthday party. I tried to make him understand that there will be
              many people around, and it doesn&apos;t look nice if I go alone.
              After a long discussion he came along with me but with great
              reluctance. On xx/yy/20zz, my parents had called my husband and
              his family for lunch. They stayed here for not more than 2 hours.
              My mother tried to talk to my mother-in-law about my husband
              behaving like this with me. My mother-in-law asked my mother to
              shut up and she threatened my mother that if she says anything
              regarding this topic, then abc will have to face
              consequences.Since I wanted a change, I decided to start working,
              which was resisted by my husband and my mother-in-law. They said
              who is going to cook for him (my husband). I told them that I will
              do all the cooking before I left for work and on that condition I
              was allowed to work. Thus I joined xyz company. My timings were
              from 9:30 am to 6:30 pm. Since I had to travel by metro I used to
              leave at 8:15 am and come back by 7:30 pm. Whenever I used to come
              from work they used to refuse to open the door, and finally when
              they used to allow me to enter the house, my husband would abuse
              me and also slap me. I was not even given enough food to eat. They
              used to say that go out and eat, we will not give you food in this
              house, and every day I was abused by my mother-in-law,
              father-in-law, and my husband. I worked in abc company only for
              9-10 days as my mother-in-law forced me to leave the job, saying
              that I have to do the household work which is more important. The
              day I had to join the company my mother-in-law did not let me eat
              anything and said that you are going to office, eat something
              there only, and she abused me. My mother-in-law had taken all my
              jewellery on the very first day that I came into their house. On
              xx/yy/20zz there was a function in my bua&apos;s place. I asked
              her for the jewellery. She refused to give it to me. I said there
              is a function, what will I wear? Still she refused to give it to
              me saying that it is lying in the locker. I had to then borrow the
              jewellery from my mother to wear on that occasion. On xx/yy/20zz
              my mami called my husband and invited all of us for lunch on
              Sunday. He told my mami that we will come. I asked him that time
              should we go on Sunday to my mami&apos;s place? He refused to go
              and said that if you want to go you go, we will not go. On
              xx/yy/20zz my mother-in-law called up my mother and threateningly
              said that since abc is not doing the household work properly my
              son will not go anywhere with her. My mother-in-law then started
              abusing me saying that I am not capable of bearing a child
              therefore I should leave the house and go. She further said that I
              had been brought to the house to bear a child. She told me to pack
              my bags and get out of the house. Since I was upset and had no one
              to turn to I came away to my parents&apos; place thinking since
              next day was a Sunday, I will come and speak to my husband. After
              I came to my parents&apos; home my mother-in-law started calling
              my mami and started threatening her that we have been cheated, no
              car was given in the marriage nor cash of Rs. 1,00,000/- was given
              as demanded by them that abc has failed to bear a child till now
              and is not doing the household work properly. On xx/yy/20zz itself
              she called my mami 3-4 times. Under the circumstances I did not
              feel it right to go back even to collect my clothes. My husband
              also did not call me up to talk. In order to save my marriage, I
              thought of going back and on xx/yy/20zz I went there but my
              mother-in-law did not open the door, and I was standing there for
              more than 15 minutes. Again on xx/yy/20zz I went there this time
              they had installed a camera on the entrance so that they could see
              who is at the door. Again I rang the bell and stood there for 15
              minutes, and came back. On xx/yy again I went but door was again
              not opened for me inspite of the care that I took of my husband. I
              was served with a legal notice dated xx/yy/20zz asking me to come
              back. But when I got back, my in-laws and husband did not let me
              inside the house. My husband has also filed for divorce for false
              reasons. Thus, I request you to take appropriate action against my
              mother-in-law and husband for torturing me and demanding dowry.

              Interrogating accused persons is an integral part of police work.
              This is as much applicable to dowry torture accused persons as it
              is to those under any other criminal law. However remember that
              the police is not all powerful. Police work in criminal matters is
              carried out totally under the supervision of the courts, even
              though the police is de jure a subordinate organ of the executive.
              They cannot throw their weight around, and the number of policemen
              who face disciplinary and legal action every year is quite large.
              Remember that the courts are not there just to punish criminals.
              It is their job to protect the human, fundamental, and legal
              rights of all citizens, including criminals. One good thing about
              our country is that there is rule of law here. It is a different
              matter that the laws are sometimes bad and/or applied selectively.
              Such things can be resolved by an alert citizenry with time.
              Coming back to the police. They are bound by the law of the land
              as much as you and I. There are many things which you ought to
              know when dealing with the police, because this is one department
              which has a lot of potential for black sheep. One thing which you
              must remember is that you are going to be dealing with people who
              are not very high up in the hierarchy. So they are not going to be
              all-powerful people even within their town police department,
              leave alone the state level. This is a good thing because there
              will always be a number of higher officers to whom you can
              complain about the behaviour of the people who are working on your
              case, in case you feel that they are doing illegal things. The
              first important thing is that you have the right to a lawyer.
              There will be people who will tell you that you have no such right
              in India, and that this is an American concept. They are probably
              under this impression because when they see Indian movies in which
              the police arrests someone, all they say is &quot;You are under
              arrest&quot; while the American policeman says &quot;You have the
              right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney.
              Anything you say can and will be held against you.&quot; This
              gives common people the impression that there are no rights for
              people who are arrested, in India. Nothing can be farther from the
              truth. The second right that you have is that the police cannot
              enter your house at any time they wish to come. They have to get
              an order from a higher officer before they can go to
              anybody&apos;s house. They only have the right to visit houses in
              connection with any investigation or administrative work or to
              apprehend fugitives from the law. They cannot enter a house during
              any time except daytime if they are visiting in connection with a
              criminal investigation. They cannot enter when a woman is alone in
              the house. They cannot enter without a woman officer if they have
              to talk to a woman. If a woman is in purdah then they have to wait
              outside until she gets suitably attired. They cannot enter the
              portions of the house which are reserved for women amongst certain
              groups of people. The police cannot demand even a glass of water
              or a chair from the resident of the house. They have to bring some
              respectable members of the locality with them if they are coming
              to visit for a search and seizure task. You are probably aware of
              the Anglo-Saxon concept of a man&apos;s house being his castle.
              Although the law in India is not as protective of a man vis-à-vis
              his home as in those countries, still there are a number of
              provisions in this respect. The third right which you have is the
              right to have a lawyer of your choice to represent you. It is not
              clear to this writer whether people in India have an absolute
              right to have a lawyer of their choice, but one thing which is
              certain is that this right definitely exists if the accused person
              is willing to pay the fees of such a lawyer. The lawyer can
              represent you in court as well as be with you while you are being
              interrogated. You can consult the lawyer from time to time during
              the questioning according to some writers. Others say that the
              lawyer can be present during the whole of the interrogation but he
              cannot dictate answers to you. Your lawyer can help you to avoid
              illegal lines of questioning. The police have no right to ask you
              questions whose answers may amount to your incriminating yourself.
              They also do not have the right to force you to undergo a marathon
              interrogation session. Remember that every country in the world
              which wishes to be counted amongst civilised countries has a right
              against self-incrimination in its law. This is the single most
              Important right in criminal law, and is a fundamental right,
              recognised under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, as a part
              of the right to life. You cannot be forced to confess to any crime
              which you might have committed. Confessions made before the police
              are not admissible in court at all. This can be circumvented by
              the police if they are able to make some recoveries on the basis
              of a confession, but such things happen only in very very serious
              matters. If a confession has to be made, it is made before a
              judge, and there can be NO police custody for any accused after he
              is brought before a judge for his confession statement, which he
              may make or may refuse to make. The accused is sent straight to
              judicial custody after such a court appearance. Further, the
              police cannot call your mother or your sister to the police
              station for interrogation. This is not allowed under the law. They
              have to go to the house of all accused persons who have not yet
              reached 15 years of age or who are members of the female gender.
              Any questioning of ladies can be done only in the presence of
              their male relatives, and women can only be searched by women.
              Further, a woman can only be brought to a police station if she
              has been formally arrested. However, policemen are terribly scared
              of bringing any woman to a police station under any circumstances
              whatsover. Bear in mind that if a woman accuses a policeman of
              raping her in a police station, then he has practically no escape
              from a conviction and subsequent life in prison. This is because
              the law specifies a presumption of guilt in the case of a
              custodial rape accusation. The punishment for custodial rape is
              the same as that for gang rape, that is to say, not less than 20
              years in jail. There are a important Supreme Court and High Court
              decisions which protect accused persons to an extent and in a
              manner which has very satisfactorily bolstered the intent inherent
              in legislated statute. One such is Nandini Satpathy vs. P.l. Dani
              case judgement, delivered by a full bench of the Supreme Court in
              1978. The three judges made several germane remarks in their
              detailed judgement. Some examples are &quot;Art. 20(3) is not a
              paper tiger but a provision to police the police and to silence
              coerced crimination.&quot;, &quot;But we confess that the
              statement of the State calls to mind the words of Hamlet :
              &quot;The lady protests too much, methinks.&quot;&quot; and
              &quot;&apos;Compelled testimony&apos; must be read as evidence
              procured not merely by physical threats or violence, but by
              psychic torture, atmospheric pressure, environmental coercion
              tiring interrogative prolixity, overbearing and intimidatory
              methods and the like –not legal penalty for violation. So the
              legal perils following upon refusal to answer or answer truthfully
              cannot be regarded as compulsion within the meaning of Art. 20(3).
              The prospect of prosecution may lead to legal tension in the
              exercise of a constitutional right, but then, a stance of silence
              is running a calculated risk. On the other hand, if there is any
              mode of pressure, subtle or crude, mental or physical, direct or
              indirect, but sufficiently substantial, applied by the policeman
              for obtaining information from an accused strongly suggestive of
              guilt it becomes compelled testimony violative of Art. 20(3)&quot;
              This last remark is a very broad and satisfactory definition of
              compelled testimony. If you are called for interrogation by the
              police, all you need to know in order to protect your rights is
              this definition of compelled testimony, and nothing more. Article
              20(3) of the Constitution lays down clearly that &quot;No person
              accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against
              himself.&quot; This statement has been interpreted by the
              judiciary in a very positive way, and as a result bans on torture,
              beating, and coercive questioning have been reiterated. The right
              to a lawyer, to not be questioned using a lie-detector or via
              narco-analysis, as well as the right to refuse to answer questions
              which are of the nature of a demand for a confession are all
              rights which are derived from this article of the Constitution.

              &quot;No arrest can be made in a routine manner on a mere
              allegation of commission of an offence made against a person. It
              would be prudent for a police officer in the interest of
              protection of the constitutional rights of a citizen and perhaps
              in his own interest that no arrest should be made without a
              reasonable satisfaction reached after some investigation as to the
              genuineness and bona fides of a complaint and a reasonable belief
              both as to the person’s complicity and even so as to the need to
              effect arrest. Denying a person of his liberty is a serious
              matter.&quot; These are the word of a chief justice of India. Let
              me capitalise (Capitalise) the words in case you have any doubt.
              These are the words of a Chief Justice of India. The Chief Justice
              of the Supreme Court of India. Worth adding is the fact that he
              was not speaking only for himself. He was at the head of a full
              bench of the Supreme Court, which included one other judge who was
              going to become the next CJI (just an observation, not that it
              matters at all here). The full bench had been constituted and
              forced to hear a petition at super speed by a most ordinary of
              ordinary citizens of India. The petition had been filed directly
              in the Supreme Court without having to go through any of the lower
              courts or any High Court. It had been heard, notices issued,
              replies taken, and the judgement delivered within 98 days of a man
              named Joginder Kumar being arrested without authorisation and
              justification by an SSP of UP Police. The reason for this
              alacrity? A Habeas Corpus petition. This is a petition which is
              designed to protect the most fundamental of your rights, the right
              without which –many feel– even the right to life is worthless.
              Your right to liberty. This judgement is pretty much a final
              judgement. It can only be challenged in front of a Constitution
              Bench of the Supreme Court, and there is no policeman in this
              country who possesses the courage or the foolishness required to
              face a Constitution Bench in order to retain the unfettered right
              to arrest anybody and everybody. Arrest can be defined as the
              imposition of restrictions on a an individual&apos;s freedom of
              movement. Some writers hold that there is no difference between
              arrest and imprisonment. Assumi observes that even the king of
              England had lost the power to arrest any of his subjects (yes,
              subjects!) without justification as far back as the signing of the
              Magna Carta. How then can the police in India claim to have
              unfettered powers of arrest in the 21st century? (Assumi, N.K.,
              Magna Carta, Habeas Corpus And Joginder Kumar Vs State Of UP,

              UP-7721.asp, 16th June 2012, viewed in Delhi on 2nd September
              2013)) Arrest and imprisonment are two of the things which are
              feared most by 498a accused persons. These fears are unfounded.
              The police cannot arrest you without recording a justification
              which will stand the scrutiny of all the courts from bottom to
              top. Otherwise there can be hell to pay. No sane police officer
              will risk the removal of his uniform to arrest a citizen on a
              whim. Remember that the police is functioning totally under the
              control of the courts in your 498a case. The courts are bound by
              the Supreme Court judgement mentioned above. This is complete
              guarantee that you cannot be arrested without
              justification.Further, even the power (of the police) to arrest
              you WITH justification flies out the moment you file an
              anticipatory bail application. It is now for the courts to decide.
              They will do justice to you, for they know the law fifty times
              better than the police. Look at the speed with which Om Puri has
              got bail in his DV case. The order of the commissioner of police
              of Delhi which says that the IO cannot arrest any accused without
              the written permission of the DCP concerned is nothing more than
              compliance with a court order coming from the highest court in the
              land. Similar orders ought to exist in all states, though this
              writer is not aware of any (perhaps because he has not bothered to
              search for them). To quote a portion of the above judgement
              &quot;The Directors General of Police of all the States in India
              shall issue necessary instructions requiring due observance of
              these requirements. In addition, departmental instruction shall
              also be issued that a police officer making an arrest should also
              record in the case diary, the reasons for making the arrest.&quot;
              A quote from Nandini Satpathy vs. P.L. Dani would also not be out
              of place here. &quot;...the policeman must be released from
              addiction to coercion and be sensitized to constitutional
              values.&quot; Further, an amendment was made to the Criminal
              Procedure Code of India in 2009, in which section 41a CrPC was
              introduced inter alia. This section mandated that the IO will
              issue a notice of appearance to persons accused of offences which
              are punishable by up to 7 years in prison, which is to say
              offences which are punishable by sentences which are of a duration
              of 7 years or less. Section 498a, Section 406, and Section 34 all
              come within the ambit of this section. The section further says
              that if an accused person complies with the notice of appearance
              and continues to comply with further notices of appearance, then
              he can not be arrested unless the IO can justify such an arrest in
              writing with cogent reasons. Lawyers protested this amendment
              vociferously because most of the income of lawyers comes from bail
              and anticipatory bail applications. (Incidentally section 498a
              composes a large number of anticipatory bail applications, and is
              very profitable.) The gazette notification of the amendment was
              deferred as a result of these protests, thus rendering it
              infructuous. However, the government surreptitiously notified this
              amendment in its gazette one fine day. This notification has led
              to the coming into force of this amendment. Now the rights of a
              498a accused man are protected, and he is safe from arrest as long
              as he continues to keep going to the police station and other
              places which he is required to visit as part of his obligations in
              his capacity as an accused person in a criminal case. It may be
              noted that the IO is required to record his reasons in either
              case, whether he makes an arrest or does not make an arrest. This
              last modification in section 41a was made to appease the
              protesting lawyers. It can work in your favour if you remain in
              your senses.

              The police may wish to arrest an accused in a particular criminal
              matter. This desire to arrest can only be justified if it has a
              legally sustainable basis. One such legal basis is a warrant for
              arrest as we all know. Another legal basis can be found in those
              sections of the CrPC which enable a policeman to make an arrest
              without any warrant for arrest. The minimum requirements for the
              exercise of the powers held by policemen and policewomen are
              delineated in section 41 of CrPC. Magistrates are entitled and
              duty bound to issue arrest warrants to arrest persons responsible
              for crimes committed within their jurisdictions. Such arrest
              warrants can be executed anywhere within the territory of India.
              Magistrates are also entitled to issue arrest warrants against
              persons who have committed crimes in other jurisdictions as long
              as such persons are located within their own jurisdictions. They
              are also empowered in terms of being able to order execution of
              arrest warrants issued by judges from other jurisdictions. Remand
              is a term which means detention after arrest. Police remand,
              judicial remand, and transit remand (police and judicial) are the
              three common types of remand. During the first 24 hours after a
              person is arrested, he can be held by the police without the need
              to produce him before a magistrate or a judge. In case he is held
              for 24 hours and the police is not able to produce him before a
              magistrate then he is to be released forthwith. If the police
              produces the arrested person before a magistrate within 24 hours
              (as is the norm), the magistrate is mandated to decide whether to
              commit the person to remand, and if to commit him to such remand
              then to which form of remand. The 24 hour requirement is given in
              section 57 of CrPC, and it comes with two provisos. (Actually the
              maximum permitted time of detention before the arrested person is
              to be taken to a magistrate is dictated by the circumstances of
              the case, and it may be as short as a couple of hours, but this
              provision of section 57 is lightly enforced.) The first one is
              that the person may be detained for more than 24 hours without
              being produced before a magistrate if there is an order from the
              same magistrate under section 167 of CrPC. The second one is that
              the arrested person may be detained by the police for 24 hours
              plus the time taken to transport him to the magistrate. Please
              note here that the magistrate in every case has to be the nearest
              one. For the purpose of illustration it may be said that the
              police cannot make the excuse that they arrested a person –who was
              wanted in Delhi– in Kanyakumari, and it took them more than 3 days
              to take him to a magistrate in Delhi. Their mandate is to take the
              arrested person to the nearest magistrate and seek police remand
              if they wish to do so. Otherwise the person may be consigned to
              judicial remand without any sort of arguments. Here it may be
              noted that the very fact that the police arrested a person makes
              them bound by the force of logic to seek remand of some sort. In
              case a person is wanted in more than one location, then the police
              from the location where he is wanted but not in custody may go to
              the location where he is in police or judicial custody and seek
              transit remand to bring him to their area and interrogate him
              there in police custody. Here it may be asked that what is the
              need to bring a person to another location just for interrogation.
              The answer is that the police may need to take him to certain
              places in their area for the purpose of reconstruction of the
              crime, or for recovery of evidence; and this is also what the
              police invariably claim. Another situation where transit remand
              may be granted is when a person is wanted by law enforcement
              authorities in one location but is living in another location in a
              different state within India. Another possible situation is that
              wherein a wanted person arrives in India via an international
              airport or port located in one particular state, and the police of
              a different state arrests him and thereafter wishes to take him to
              their own state. Interstate travel is common to all these
              situations.It is also possible that a magistrate may visit a
              police station for a remand hearing. This happens in serious
              matters usually, and is not a real probability in 498a or other
              dowry related cases. It is immaterial whether the arrestee is
              taken before the magistrate or the magistrate comes to him. This
              is like the mountain and Mohammad. To prove the fact or the
              &apos;fact&apos; that the arrestee was taken before a magistrate
              before being remanded in custody, all that is required is the
              signature of the magistrate on the remand order. It goes without
              saying that such a provision is susceptible to misuse. Even when a
              person is arrested subsequent to an arrest warrant or warrants
              issued by a judge, he cannot be detained by the police for more
              than 24 hours without producing him before the magistrate in whose
              jurisdiction the arrest was made. The justification for this
              provision is provided by Article 21 of the Constitution and the
              right to liberty therein, and (in a narrower and alternative
              sense) by the judicial logic that any investigation which cannot
              be completed within 24 hours needs to be referred to a judicial
              officer for assessment as to its merits in terms of necessity for
              continuation. When the magistrate hears the police, he may permit
              police custody for not more than 15 days. Usually this is granted
              for one or two days maximum in the case of 498a, if at all it is
              granted. The police can then produce the person again before the
              magistrate for extension of police remand if it is required.
              Second requests are even more commonly refused than initial
              requests. This is a good thing, and takes India one step away from
              turning into a police state. After all the extensions, the judge
              has to send the arrestee to judicial custody within a maximum of
              15 days. This also is to be done in case the judge is convinced
              that judicial remand is necessary to prevent adverse events.
              Remand in total (including police remand as well as judicial
              remand) shall not be more than 60 days in most cases, and
              certainly not more than 90 days for arrests made under offences
              punishable by a term of not less than 10 years (or life, or
              death). This is not put in practice in a number of cases. But
              usually a person is set free upon execution of a bail bond at the
              end of such a period. This is done subsequent to a mandatory offer
              of bail to the accused. For this bail offer, there is no need to
              make any bail application. So it may be rightly said that the bail
              given at the end of the maximum period of detention is, strictly
              speaking, bail without the need for a bail application. It must be
              mentioned that normally an accused person cannot be set free even
              after being granted bail if he is not willing or able to execute a
              bail bond. This is of course subject to the jurisprudential
              provision about indigence which has been explained in detail
              elsewhere in this website, along with the details of bail bond
              execution. A person may be subjected to police remand subsequent
              to judicial remand, or between episodes of judicial remand.
              Surprisingly this is permitted. But any confession given in the
              second or subsequent rounds of police custody are not be taken
              seriously at all, in case the arrestee was produced before a judge
              for a confession statement at the end of the first round of police
              custody, and he refused to confess. This is explained in more
              detail in the article about police investigation and
              interrogation. Interestingly, the grounds for not permitting the
              police to hold an arrested person for more than 24 hours without
              etc. is based upon the premise that police custody can be misused
              to torture an accused person. What this logic seems to have missed
              out is that a person can be tortured very badly within 24 hours,
              and this has been a common occurrence throughout the history of
              India, although now things appear to have improved slightly. In
              any case, dowry accused persons do not ordinarily have to worry
              about torture (or even at all worry about torture) because the
              police invariably does such things only to people who are
              illiterate or from backward sections of society. You do not have
              much to fear in your 498a case, unless you decide to let vested
              interests scare you.

              Why is Marriage Considered to be Such a Great Thing?

              Marriage is an interesting theme to explore in a written
              exposition. This writer estimates that on average, people spend
              around half of their life searching for a suitable mate, and
              usually the rest of their life living with the mate and/or their
              offspring. The whole world is obsessed with marriage, and why
              should it not be? After all, marriage provides so many benefits
              that it has the potential to be the best thing one can do in
              one&apos;s life. All over the world, marriage is added to the
              birth-death duality as a natural step in a human life. It is not
              inevitable for all living beings, unlike birth and death. Marriage
              is probably an indicator of hope for beginning the reproduction
              phase of life in the cross-culturally pervasive descriptive triad
              (viz. birth, marriage, and death) –reproduction being what makes
              the circle of life complete. Celebrating Marriage Life is full of
              endless possibilities. To be able to breathe, to see, to hear, to
              think, to touch, to talk, to feel, to create –all these things are
              possible only when the doer is alive. Most of these experiences
              are pleasurable. So it may be said that life gives most of us the
              chance to experience pleasures. Death is the end of all
              possibilities. Nobody knows what lies beyond. So death may be
              described as an event which ends all possibility of future
              opportunities to experience pleasures. Celebrating pleasure or
              celebrating the creation of the possibility to create virtually
              endless opportunities to experience pleasures (since we all hope
              and believe that we will live forever) is a natural thing. Since
              birth is the creation of life, and hence the creation of
              possibilities, it is to be celebrated. Additionally, reproduction
              follows the most sensually pleasurable act in human life, so it is
              inevitable that getting a license to reproduce should be
              celebrated as a license to enjoy. Another reason to celebrate is
              the appearance of the prospect of the birth of future generations.
              This is why births and marriages are celebrated. To mourn the end
              of a pleasurable era is also natural –which explains why most
              deaths are mourned (except when a death marks the end of an
              oppression). Marriage and Family as a Support System Marriage is
              something which is considered almost essential for the creation
              and support of a family unit, which keeps growing and shrinking as
              new members are born and old ones die. A family is a great social
              construct for taking care of young individuals of the species when
              they are too young to fend for themselves. These young ones grow
              up and at a later stage care for their original carers when the
              carers are too old to care for themselves. People who are situated
              outside family structures face great difficulties in life. Orphans
              encounter immense social and economic barriers in their quest to
              reach a reasonable position in life, or even just to survive. They
              have a very short life expectancy, and tales of their mental,
              physical and sexual abuse are legion. It is also observed that
              childless couples are often reduced to helplessness and penury in
              old age, and it is sometimes heard that a similarly placed person
              died in their house with nobody around who could call an
              ambulance. Cases of such people being murdered or robbed are also
              very common. They are also vulnerable to mental torture because
              the torturer knows that he/she is likely to get away with it. In
              Indian law, if and when a person commits suicide due to harassment
              by another person or group of persons, the police does not
              register a case against such persons unless and until there is a
              written complaint from the relatives of the suicide. If a person
              has no relatives, then how can his relatives make a written
              complaint? It is logical that written complaints by friends of the
              deceased should be accepted as the basis for an FIR; but in the
              21st century –when often even people with wives and children feel
              that they are friendless– what chance of having friends does an
              orphan have? Similarly, children whose parents get divorced are
              invariably traumatised by the break-up, and encounter great
              difficulties in developing a healthy personality with a strong
              sense of self and the ability to take the knocks of life
              successfully. Similar life-experiences are reported by those
              children who lose one of their parents in early life OR children
              who live in dysfunctional families with an alcoholic or
              excessively irritable parent. Many such individuals end their
              lives themselves, as can be seen from empirical studies conducted
              by experts in the fields of sociology, psychology, and psychiatry.
              Marriage: The Best Type of Social Security Families created by
              marriages are the bedrock of society. Property earned by parents
              is usually kept within the family, and children are encouraged to
              follow the family profession, with support from their parents.
              This is particularly true of the son or daughter who is expected
              to support the parents in their old age, depending upon whether
              the family is located in a patriarchal or a matriarchal culture
              inter alia. The money earned by the parents using the family as a
              support structure comes in useful for the children&apos;s
              upbringing, in terms of providing education and the facilities of
              modern life to them. In their turn, the children support the
              parents in their old age, and the family money is used to care for
              their healthcare and hospitalisation in times of need. Thus the
              family unit continues to support the generations as they make
              their appearance. This social security has historically been
              provided in a more robust way by the family unit than any other
              social structure ever invented by man. Stable family units
              –multiplied by thousands or even millions– constitute society as a
              whole; a stable, prosperous society. A Means for the Growth of the
              Individual and Society A prominent clergyman in America named
              Cardinal Nolan recently said that strong societies are founded
              upon strong marriages. Identical sentiments have been expressed by
              many prominent persons globally –over the past century and this
              one. Indeed, society cannot grow if individuals and legitimate
              social groupings cannot grow. An overwhelming majority of
              successful and healthy individuals in society are the products of
              happy marriages. Due to the large size of the global population,
              and due to differing definitions of success, there can only be
              anecdotal evidence in support of this observation; but the number
              of people who corroborate such a conclusion is exceedingly large,
              and much much larger than the number of people who hold the
              opposing view. Stable and happy marriages provide a source of
              members for the workforce of any nation. The well-adjusted and
              happy children who are born in such families do well in schools
              and colleges, and become law abiding and productive citizens.
              Scientists, doctors, engineers, you name them, most of them are
              products of stable marriages. In societies with large percentages
              of broken marriages, illegitimate social group-types and social
              structures tend to grow to puissance. Gambling rings, criminal
              gangs, prostitution rackets, and the like thrive in such
              societies. The calming and stabilising influence of family
              groupings, circles of relatives, satsangs / church groups,
              schools, colleges, benign government et al is diminished. Health
              Benefits of Strong Marriages Regular and loving sex –without the
              risk of catching any infection– is a tonic and ego reinforcement
              like no other. A healthy ego is the sine qua non of mental health.
              To always have somebody who is ready to praise you, support you,
              and to stand by you in difficult times gives great mental strength
              and peace. All the positive energies are stimulated in the happily
              married individual. These provide a strong foundation for a
              healthy physique and psyche. Sexual satisfaction stops a person
              from looking for harmful addictions, and a supportive partner
              ensures further protection from suchlike. Great incentive for
              physical fitness is provided by the boost to mental health due to
              the presence of loved ones who cheer every success of their family
              members. The happy neurotransmitters like serotonin
              (happiness/satisfaction) and dopamine (pleasure) and hormones like
              oxytocin (trust and love) and epinephrine (ability to face tough
              situations and stress) are secreted by the various glands due to
              great sex and companionship. Endorphins (happiness) are also
              released in great amounts during lovemaking. Cholesterol levels go
              down in happy individuals, and blood pressure is more likely to be
              stable in a happy person than a sad one. Neuropsychiatric
              conditions are rare in happy marriages. Alcoholism does not rear
              its head very often in such marriages. There is practically no
              incentive for ulcers to grow in the body of a stress-free person.
              Cancers of the lungs, throat, kidney, and oesophagus don&apos;t
              occur at a high rate if people do not smoke or consume harmful
              substances. Other cancers are also less common in stress-free
              individuals. A stress-free life makes the appearance of diabetes
              and related complications improbable. Healthy parents produce
              healthy children. There is quicker development of the individual
              to maturity if he is in a happy place. The next generation is
              produced earlier, and its appearance is surer –as is its success
              in replicating itself and its own success. The continuity of the
              line is almost guaranteed. The whole species benefits from the
              presence of happy families.

              This writer has vast experience in life, and has seen many
              varieties of people. In one of the colleges where he had the good
              fortune to teach, there came for a short time a retired subedar
              major from the army, employed by the college in the role of a
              section officer in the school of architecture. This particular
              gentleman had a habit of describing the various things that he had
              seen during his time in the army, which was spent fruitfully in
              all corners of the country. The subedar major often narrated his
              time spent on a mountain top in the north-eastern part of India.
              It seems that the impression that a particular routine of life on
              that mountain left on him was deep. Apparently a local tribal
              lived on that mountain with his nubile daughter. The daughter was
              at an age when fathers in those regions start worrying about
              finding a groom for them, and grooms start lining up to meet the
              hopefully comely beauty. One healthy bare-chested young man used
              to run up the mountain with a torch in his hand, and present a
              bottle of honey to the &apos;old&apos; man. The old man used to
              permit the young man to meet his daughter and spend a few nights
              with her. (n.b. The subedar major was a native of western U.P.,
              and the exact word that he used for the object carried by the
              young suitor was &apos;torch&apos;. I would surmise from this that
              the torch in question was a battery powered flashlight). The young
              man used to go away after his allotted time, only to come back
              again after a few days, and –the girl permitting– the father and
              the athlete used to repeat the whole performance. Evidently this
              was not the only mountain in those sparsely populated parts where
              such a thing was happening. The deal here was that a) If the young
              suitor kept coming back, b) the father kept greeting and meeting
              him, c) the girl kept allowing him to spend time with her, and d)
              If he could impregnate the girl within a year, then he could take
              her home to his own mountain. If he however failed in his
              endeavour, then he would go away and never return again, yielding
              his place in her boudoir to the next strapping lad that came along
              with a torch and a bottle of honey. Many readers will have
              recognised in this tale the phenomenon commonly described as being
              engaged. This was a de facto conditional engagement like all
              engagements in the world (although many engagements worldwide are
              not conditional in a de jure sense). The condition here was to
              test the strength, dedication, virility, and fertility of a suitor
              before letting him have a wife. There was no wedding ceremony as
              such, but the courtship was rich with symbolism and ritual
              –essential ingredients of weddings the world over. Once this
              writer had the opportunity to work and live in the Lion City. A
              charming Chinese estate agent found him a room with an Indian
              family in one of the auspiciously numbered suburbs on the north
              line of the MRT. The time spent in Singapore was hectic with long
              working hours at the office on Orchard Road, and practically no
              time for relaxation. However one got the opportunity to view Sun
              TV and Tamil culture from close quarters during the times spent at
              home with Aunty Gunashagiri, Uncle Naidu, and Siva and his younger
              brother –the one with long hair, and a ghunghroo in one ankle.
              Aunty Gunashagiri and Uncle Naidu had an elder daughter who was
              married and whose husband was working in some security wing of the
              government. They had a cute young daughter and a baby son, and all
              four used to visit the house often –the children staying back for
              some time with granny. Apparently Siva was a possible suitor for
              his young niece; in fact a preferred suitor, with the right of
              first refusal. This is a phenomenon known as avunculate marriage.
              A few movies on Sun TV also showed glimpses of this totally
              acceptable system in Tamil Society. The wife in such a marriage is
              her own niece, and the groom is his own uncle-in-law. Strange
              though it may appear to many in northern India, this is a fairly
              common practice amongst the people of a number of Indian states.
              Fifty percent of marriages in the villages of Tamil Nadu and
              Andhra Pradesh are consanguineous marriages –marriages between
              people who are related by blood.Similarly, Punjabi Aroras in
              northern India have been commonly known to practice marriages
              between sons and daughters of brothers and sisters. An Arora girl
              living in this writer&apos;s neighbourhood is married to a man who
              is technically her uncle. In other castes also this has been
              observed, especially amongst those who migrated from western
              Punjab at the time of partition. So it can be said that such
              marriages are commonly practiced in specific communities in many
              parts of India. There exists a phenomenon of exchange marriages in
              some Punjabi castes. In this system the brother and sister are
              married off to another brother and sister. In Pakistan and
              Afghanistan this phenomenon is called Watta-Satta. The logic
              behind this system is to keep a double pressure on all the spouses
              to not leave their spouses and to treat them properly. A similar
              but not identical phenomenon is prevalent in many many castes and
              cultures not only in India but across the world, in which two
              brothers marry two sisters. In Hindi movies also it is commonly
              shown that the brother of a husband falls in love with the sister
              of the husband&apos;s wife, i.e. his own brother&apos;s
              sister-in-law. The movie Hum Aapke Hain Kaun had a similar theme.
              Many castes have a system where if the elder brother dies, then
              the younger brother marries his wife, his own bhabhi. This has
              also been shown in at least one hindi movie, based on a popular
              novel named Ek Chaadar Maili Si. An interesting question comes up
              here. What if two brothers married two sisters, and one of the
              brothers dies? Apparently the answer in olden days was that the
              remaining brother used to be made married to two sisters in such
              an eventuality. This was done amongst Jats and some others, though
              it would be interesting to know how Muslim Jats reacted to such
              situations, considering the fact that marriage of one man with two
              sisters is prohibited according to Islamic scripture. The Jats and
              the Jatts of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Delhi, and
              a few other states avoid marrying persons who have even one out of
              two, three, or four gotras in common with them. The four gotras
              which used to be traditionally considered were 1) father&apos;s
              gotra (or own gotra), 2) mother&apos;s gotra, 3) paternal
              grandmother&apos;s gotra, and 4) maternal grandmother&apos;s
              gotra. If any one out of these four gotras of the boy and girl
              were common, then they could not marry each other, as they were
              considered to be brother and sister. Let me explain this more
              clearly for the benefit of those who are unable to wrap their
              heads around this concept. Say for example that the gotras
              relevant to the boy are 1) Malik 2) Siwach 3) Shaukeen and 4)
              Gehlot; and the gotras pertaining to the girl are 1) Dabas 2)
              Dahiya 3) Lamba and 4) Malik, then the boy and the girl could not
              marry each other, because Malik is common for both. In later
              times, this came down to exclusion of first three gotras only, to
              the exclusion of Nani&apos;s (maternal grandmother&apos;s) gotra.
              So these days the boy and girl in the foregoing example are
              eligible to marry each other, because Malik is the fourth gotra
              for the girl. Now, in many parts of the country, only the first
              two gotras are excluded. Further, marrying a girl from your own
              village –no matter what her gotra– was prohibited and remains
              prohibited. This is because all girls of your own village are
              considered to be your sisters. The much maligned Khap Panchayats
              (maligned by a campaign led by the TOI group publications and
              channels) are against the practice of same gotra and same village
              marriages. They are not against inter-caste marriages provided
              that the boy and the girl do not belong to the same village. In
              Islam, a man can marry up to four wives, as long as he can keep
              all of them equally happy. He is not allowed to marry two sisters,
              a mother and a daughter, and a few other combinations. Although
              this is permitted in the Sharia, many Islamic countries do not
              allow polygamy. Anyway it is easier said than done to keep two or
              more women equally happy. Anybody who has ever tried to or has
              ever been forced to try to have two relationships at the same time
              knows what this writer is talking about. In India, the current
              legal position on this issue is that of uncertainty. Polyandry was
              common in mountainous parts of India in earlier times, and traces
              of it remain to this day. One woman could marry a number of
              brothers, and it was often not clear which child was from which
              father. This led to preservation of land holdings within one
              family. Since land was and is scarce in the hills, this tradition
              served a useful purpose. There have been reports of polyandry from
              agrarian communities in Punjab in the past and in recent days also
              –perhaps triggered by depleting land holdings. Matriarchy can be
              seen amongst some communities in India, as is matrilocal residence
              post marriage. The Jaintia, Khasi and Garo communities have
              matrilocal, patrilocal as well as neolocal residence post
              marriage. Nair communities in Kerala have a similar system.
              Matrilocal residence occurs when the woman is an heiress,
              otherwise the other two types prevail.

              Once during his extended sojourn in Central Asia, this writer had
              the opportunity to meet an Ingush woman from the Caucasus, and to
              learn about her life. A charming lady who carried a .22 caliber at
              all times, she informed him with pride that a man who liked her
              kidnapped her on an impulse when she was all of 15 years old, and
              &apos;married&apos; her –and then he really married her. All by
              force. This was while she lived in the wild east town of
              Makhachkala in Dagestan on the Caspian, where such things are not
              a rarity. She bore him two children and was eternally grateful to
              him for having the courage to kidnap her against her wish. At the
              time when this writer met this woman, her daughter was 23 years
              old, and she was totally against letting any man kidnap her in
              order to marry her. Her experience did not seem out of place in
              the twin republics of Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan in Central Asia,
              where Ala-Kachuu or Alyp Qashu (bride-kidnapping) is a widespread
              phenomenon –even though it has been an illegal act for a number of
              years now, albeit rarely prosecuted. (Of course it is a different
              matter that nothing bad seems out of place in Kyrgyzstan, where
              the officially recorded intentional homicide rate is seven to
              eight times greater than India. Nazarbayev&apos;s Kazakhstan is no
              different in its essence; when a popular opposition leader
              Zamanbek Nurkadilov was found with one shot to the back of his
              head and two to his chest, it was ruled a suicide by the
              prosecutor general.) Bride kidnapping is done sometimes with and
              sometimes without the woman&apos;s consent. In New Zealand back at
              the turn of the century, this writer noted that the institution of
              marriage in the larger cities survives mostly in the form of de
              facto partnerships, and you are much more likely to meet a person
              who describes his or her partner as just that, and not as a wife
              or a husband. While this is a relatively new phenomenon for the
              Pakeha (NZ European) majority, many pacific island people (like
              the Samoans for example) who constitute a significant portion of
              the population of Auckland are inveterate practitioners of live-in
              relationships from olden days. There is a perfunctory exchange of
              gifts between a man and a woman, and then they start living
              together. Chinese and Indian immigrants are also picking up this
              form of marriage very quickly. This is all between humans, and
              reports about Kiwi men marrying their sheep are purely
              speculative, though understandable considering the emergence of
              literacy amongst harem fantasists who see tremendous scope in the
              sixty four million merinos in the land of the long white cloud.
              While on the topic of live-in relationships amongst Chinese and
              Indians, it is interesting to note that this phenomenon is
              spreading to many traditionally restrictive cultures too. In
              Singapore, young Chinese yuppie women consider it a status symbol
              to have a white boyfriend (or a Caucasian boyfriend –as they are
              referred to in this Chinese dominated culture, where the local
              authorities do not encourage the use of the word &apos;white&apos;
              for Europeans, as they consider themselves to be white too, and do
              not wish to let any foreign ethnic group monopolise this
              adjective). This phenomenon is reflective both of a national urge
              to marry the desirable ethnicity, as well as the liberation of
              women to the point where they can reject their own men for no
              fault of theirs, all the time making jokes about a sensitive
              physical attribute, inter alia. In India too, the trend of
              living-in has emerged in certain small but influential social
              pockets. The Indian experience, however, is laden with rape
              accusations post break-up, as can be made out from a rash of news
              reports in the past few months. However the most charming
              contribution made by India to women&apos;s liberation and the
              institution of marriage remains the Swayamvar, which means
              self-selection of her groom by a bride. The fact that there is no
              special word for selection by parents indicates that the
              predominance of arranged marriages is of an ancient
              provenance.Lord Ram married Sita after performing a task set by
              her father. Arjun did something similar to gain Draupadi&apos;s
              hand. These were task oriented swayamvars. The other common type
              of swayamvar was the one in which the bride selected the suitor
              who she found most charming. Desirable girls in India in the
              twenty first century also practice a de facto form of swayamvar,
              although they don&apos;t gather a crowd of men at one time and
              place for this purpose. This is partly the result of the
              prevailing skewed gender ratio nationwide, and partly due to the
              desirability of the girl under consideration. The Bible and other
              Mediterranean histories have several references to men stealing
              other men&apos;s wives and marrying them, with different end
              results. The wives are often depicted as innocent figures in the
              whole game. Paris kidnapped Helen of Troy and was killed
              eventually. David –slayer of Goliath, father of Solomon, and
              ancestor of Jesus Christ– seduced Bathsheba and then organised the
              killing of her husband Uriah at the hands of enemy troops. In
              ancient Egypt, many of the Pharaohs married their own sisters.
              This was apparently done to preserve the purity of the royal line.
              They even included this phenomenon in their mythology. Isis and
              Osiris were ancient deities who were siblings and married each
              other. Isis went on give birth to Osiris&apos; child Horus, the
              hawk-faced Egyptian god. On Earth, there was a long line of
              Ptolemies and Cleopatras, brothers and sisters who were married to
              each other. The final Cleopatra –the one who is famous in history–
              married her father Ptolemy after his wife/sister died. After his
              death she married two of her brothers –also named Ptolemy– one
              after the other. Later on she had a relationship with Julius
              Caesar, and married Marc Antony after Julius Caesar&apos;s death,
              but these men were not her brothers by far, although the word
              &apos;brother&apos; was evidently meaningless in that time and
              place, and it would have only made a positive difference to the
              probability of her and them having sexual relations had they been
              siblings. In the USA, marriage followed by divorce as a means to
              personal enrichment is extremely common, and has been commented
              upon by many writers. The one phenomenon relating to marriage in
              America which is most notable goes by the name of Las Vegas.
              People elope and get married in Lost Wages, at very low cost
              compared to a traditional wedding, without the bother of gathering
              a crowd of relatives and friends or organising a feast. Pastors
              who solemnise weddings in this town often dress up as Elvis or
              Marilyn Monroe or Mickey Mouse or (insert name of your favourite
              personage here) to bring that extra touch to a wedding. It is also
              possible to have your honeymoon in Paris or Venice without leaving
              this town. Drive through chapels to get married are a phenomenon
              unique to Vegas, and are a fitting second act to getting a
              marriage license in a matter of minutes. Marriages exist in Brazil
              also, but just how the institution has managed to survive is
              unfathomable. Brazilians are rumoured to **** anyone who catches
              their fancy. This is quite problematic, considering the fact that
              this country tops the table of countries vis-à-vis the percentage
              of attractive people in their population. Football is NOT their
              national sport, reports to the contrary notwithstanding. Another
              soccer crazy country which has pretty much the same problematic or
              joyful situation is the Netherlands –home to the city of
              Amsterdam. Incidentally both these countries were pioneers in the
              recognition of same sex marriages. Russia on the other hand treats
              homosexual propaganda as a criminal offence, but adultery is
              evidently their national sport, pretty much like the Brazilians.
              It also has the highest rate of herpes infections in the world,
              incidentally, and the divorce and suicide rates are quite simply
              stupefying. Rampant corruption, unpunished crime and endemic
              alcoholism are often claimed to be punishment from God for
              adultery by members of the Orthodox Christian clergy. Brazil is
              also not untouched by crime. Some visitors to Delhi remarked to an
              audience which included this writer that it was a pleasant
              surprise to see that beggars in Delhi actually begged instead of
              grabbing. Another –perhaps apocryphal– story goes that bus drivers
              in Rio, Sao Paulo and Belo Horizonte wear wristwatches on their
              right wrists to prevent them from being snatched by people who ask
              the time. In China politicians often marry more than once, or keep
              concubines. Some successful and active men have been known to have
              more than a dozen such. Successful Japanese men have traditionally
              sought companionship from Geishas who excel in the art of
              conversation and ego-massage, while using their wives for
              child-rearing. Marrying and divorcing within a day or a week is a
              phenomenon which can be seen in a number of Arab countries, where
              sex outside marriage is a crime. Saddam Hussein, otherwise no
              observant Muslim in life –though he died with the name of Allah on
              his lips– stuck to a maximum number of four wives. Muammar Gaddafi
              too married only twice. Both these men had many ladies outside
              marriage, with Gaddafi being reported to have more notches on his
              belt than any man dead or alive. Many national leaders have had
              failed marriages, with Indira Gandhi, Nicolas Sarkozy, and
              Vladimir Putin being names that spring to mind immediately. Many
              have opted to remain single. There was a time when both the
              President (Abdul Kalam) and the Prime Minister (Vajpayee) of the
              country were bachelors, and Digvijay Singh had infamously blamed
              drought in India on the fact of being ruled by such men.

              A will should be written in a way which should not leave any scope
              for doubts. It must contain a number of sections to achieve this.
              An example of a well written will with all such sections is given
              here with the hope that it is self-explanatory. Last Will and
              Testament Declaration of identity and purpose I, ABC XYZ, son of

              rendering all previous wills and codicils null and void I declare
              that any and all wills and codicils prepared by me prior to this
