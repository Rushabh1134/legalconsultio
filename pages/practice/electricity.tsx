    <div><p>The Ministry of Power (MOP) on 31 December 2020 notified the Electricity (Rights of Consumers) Rules 2020 (Consumer Rights Rules). The Consumer Rights Rules intend to bring more accountability in the distribution companies towards the consumers. The rules also envisage a robust grievance redressal mechanism between consumers and a distribution licensee, and requires the distribution licensee to maintain a centralised toll-free 24/7 call centre to address common services such as new connection, disconnection, and change of name and particulars. The Consumer Rights Rules cover (among others) the following areas:<br/>
    Rights and obligations of consumers and distribution licensees.
Connection, metering arrangement, billing and payment.
Standards of performance of the licensee, and compensation in case of failure to meet those standards.
Prosumers. A prosumer is a person who consumes electricity from the grid and can also inject electricity into the grid for a distribution licensee, using the same point of supply. A prosumer continues to maintain consumer status and also has the right to set up renewable energy generation unit (including roof top solar photovoltaic systems either on its own, or through a service provider).</p></div>
